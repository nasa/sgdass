  spd_server runs on gs698-xyz4.gsfc.nasa.gov
  
  If you try to access to the spd server from another computer,
  use command 

  ssh -fNL 16000:localhost:16000  gs698-xyz4.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The system will ask you the password at gs698-xyz4.gsfc.nasa.gov
  and set up tunnel at port 16000 to localhost. That means your 
  request to the local host at port 16000 will be secure tunneled
  to gs698-xyz4.gsfc.nasa.gov till you log out or gs698-xyz4.gsfc.nasa.gov
  is rebooted.

  spd_client is installed at both gs698-xyz4.gsfc.nasa.gov and gs698-xyz3.gsfc.nasa.gov

  To test connection, execute command 
  
  /Users/lpetrov/opt/bin/spd_cli_example ping

  you should get response 

  Server localhost ( 127.0.0.1 ) is OK
