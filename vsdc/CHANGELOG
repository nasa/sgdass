2024.02.04  1.22  a) Added program vsdc_get_swin_dir.py. It gets the list 
                     of files that are either present at the data center 
                     for the specified year ( option -l ) or specified in 
                     the IVS master file, but still missing ( option -m ).
                  b) Added support of the second argument to vget that
                     specifies the output file name.

2023.05.31  1.21  a) Added printing the server response to stdout
                     in the verbose log when verbosity level > 2
                     is used. 
                  b) Fixed a typo in the name of the verbose 
                     log file: vsds_debug_log.txt --> vsdc_debug_log.txt

2023.05.09  1.20  Added support of debugging output. 
                  When swin_up.csh or swin_up.bash is 
                  invoked with --verb 3, verbose log
                  is appended to file vsds_debug_log.txt
                  in directory specified in the keyword
                  LARGE_TMP_DIR of the vsdc control file.

                  b) wget option --password was replaced with 
                     --http-password because some version of wget 
                     did not process correctly option --password.
                  c) Format of log submission file was changed

2021.12.18  1.17  a) Changed installation. Now python code remains
                     in the directory where it was uncompressed.
                     Five wrappers, vget, swin_up.csh, swin_up.bash, 
                     vsdc.csh, vsdc.bash are copied to ${prefix/bin
                     directory.
                  b) Updated vsdc_find_ffdir.py to support a case when
                     no alist file is in the Fourfit generated directory.
                 
                  c) Added support of uploading session_vex, session_txt,

                     arguments in an arbitrary order.
                  b) Fixed a bug that generated incorrect tar archive
                     when relative path to Level 1A was used or 
                     the Level 1A path was a symbolic link
                  c) Added support of a case when vex and/or v2d
                     reside in a subdirectory.
                  d) Added two more comments in the meta file to 
                     help debugging.

2021.06.25  1.15  a) Added support of a case when Fourfit files may
                     be in more than one subdirectory.
                  b) Fixed swin_up.csh and swin_up.bash for a case
                     when no Fourfit files were found.
                  c) Added more verbosity when -v 4 is specified.

2021.06.22  1.14
                  a) Changed the logic of bypassing Fourfit directory.
                     VSDC_SWIN_EXCLUDE is applied by python to the input 
                     file instead of tar. VSDC_SWIN_EXCLUDE doe not 
                     support regular expression.
                  b) Added options -nosubmit and -verb in swin_up.bash and 
                     swin_up.csh
                  c) Made swin_up.csh and swin_up.bash to print vsdc
                     version and whether Fourfit files were found.
                  d) Added support of -v 3 and -v 4 for more verbosity
                     for debugging.

2021.06.02  1.13 
                  a) Added support of environment variable VSDC_SWIN_EXCLUDE
                  b) Added a search of Fourfit directory, and if the 
                     Fourfit directory is found, it is excluded from
                     archiving.

2021.05.10  1.04  
                  a) Changed the first line of the configuration file to
                     # VSDC_CONFIG file. Version 1.04 of 2021.05.10

                  b) Added a new option TAR_SWIN_EXCLUDE: in the control file:
                     a pattern to exclude files or directories when generating
                     swin tar file. See tar for format of this option.
                     This option can be set to "" or omitted.
                     More than one option TAR_SWIN_EXCLUDE is allowed.      

                  c) Added a new option CURL_EXTRA_OPTS: in the control file:
                     extra parameters passed to curl. An extra option may be 
                     needed for handling secure socket layer (ssl).
                     For instance, some users need supply option
                     --ciphers DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1 , while submission will fail
                     if users from another analysis center will use this option.
                     CURL_EXTRA_OPTS can be set to "" or omitted.

                  d) Added a new option WGET_EXTRA_OPTS: in the control file:
                     extra parameters passed to wget.
                     WGET_EXTRA_OPTS can be set to "" or omitted.

                  e) Added auxiliary program vsdc_conf_update.py for an update
                     of the vsdc control file from old versions.

                  f) Added swin_up.bash -- a sister of swin_up.csh

                  g) Made swin_up.bash and swin_up.csh to read vsdc control 
                     file and extract LARGE_TMP_DIR option to specify the 
                     directory where temporarily put tar file.

                  h) Fixed a bug: comments in vex files could be treated as valid 
                     definitions.

                  i) Fixed a bug: vsdc check name of the config file, but not 
                     the field DATA_CENTER.
