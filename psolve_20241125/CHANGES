1.10 2023.12.16

     a) Added support of TEC_BIAS, TEC_SCAL, EXT_ERR keywords.

     b) Added support of different repositories

     c) Added several database to share directory, and made
        solve to populate OBS and INT repository during 
        installation if they are empty.

     d) Added support of key (R) in OPTIN to change the database
        repository.

     e) Fixed several bugs that derailed imposing constraints when
        the total number of estimated parameters exceeded 65536.

     f) Added support of qualifier SRC_PRP_SIGMA for support of
        reciprocal weights imposed on estimates of source proper
        motions.

     g) Added support of keywords DEFINE and UNDEFINE in the 
        $GSETUP section. Keyword DEFINE defines the environment
        variable that is used within batch SOLVE. Keyword UNDEFINE
        removes the environment variable.


1.9  2023.03.14

     a) updated eop_alignment

     b) added a new program src_alignment

     c) added a new keyword PROPER_MOTIONS in the constraint
        section

     d) Changed listing format for source proper motions

     e) Changed listing format for source proper motions
   
     g) Added two new output files for getpar 
        -- constraint information file
        -- estimates of source proper motions

     h) Added support of keywords EXT_ERRVAR_DEBUG and SOLVEVAR_DIR_DEBUG
        keywords for setting environment variables with these names

1.8  2022.08.23

     a) Added support of estimation of the ionospheric scale


1.7  2021.01.20.

     a) Increased the number of sources to 32766

     b) Added program simul  for generation of the simulated database

     c) Added program sumobs for comparison of the simulated database
        with the real one


1.6  2020.10.27.

     a) Increased the number of stations in one experiment to 256.

     b) Eliminated the need of limits statcksize  and setenv GOMP_STACKSIZE.
        Now psolve works without it.

     c) Library vex_parser now required ( http://astrogeo.org/vex_parser )

1.5  2020.05.01.

     a) Added support of EDIT option in the session list

     b) Added new utility suppress_cgm

     c) Now Solve is working under MACOS.

1.4  2019.09.15.

     a) Added support of gvf generated by nusolve.

     b) Bug fixes.

1.3  2018.05.31.

     a) Added support of NERS

     b) Added support of PSOLVE_ELMIN environment variable. It sets
        the default cutoff limit in degrees. For batch Solve 
        the keyword ELEVATION overwrites PSOLVE_ELMIN

     c) Fixed bugs related for gfortran 8.1

     d) Fixed two left-over bugs related to 32->64 bit transition.


1.2  2017.11.27. 

     a) Fixed non-net-rotation constraints for proper motion

     b) Fixed crashes related to lack information about 
        ionospheric frequencies for bad observations

     c) Renamed programs:
        solve       --> psolve
        solve_reset --> psolve_reset

     d) Renamed environment variables:
        SOLVE_DIR --> PSOLVE_DIR
        HELP_DIR  --> PSOLVE_HELP_DIR
        SAVE_DIR  --> PSOLVE_SAVE_DIR
        WORK_DIR  --> PSOLVE_WORK_DIR
        CGM_DIR   --> PSOLVE_CGM_DIR
	SPOOL_DIR --> PSOLVE_SPOOL_DIR

1.1  2017.11.20. 

     a) Full support of 32-bit vector indices and 64-bit matrix indices.
        MAX_PAR (the maximum number of parameters) was raised to 100000. 
        Tests showed no issues when the number of parameters is 
        less 46340. Probably, bugs remained that may result in a crash
        if the number of parameters exceeds 46340.
     
     b) Parameter indices of user partials was converted from INTEGER*2
        to INTEGER*4.

1.0  2017.10.23. 

     The first release of Post-Solve (or psolve).
     Prominent changes with respect to the old version of Solve.

     a) Support of gfortran under Linux;
     b) Support of 64-bit environment;
     c) Support up to 32700 estimated parameters;
     d) drop of catalogue system, calc, dbedit, pwxcb, dbcal, 
        x1k, catlg4, pc8, phase_doctor, mark3_to_gvh.
     e) entirely new installation environment: 
        configure, make, make install.
