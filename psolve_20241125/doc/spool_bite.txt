   Program  SPOOL_BITE is for extraction of a small portion from
Solve spool file. Since Solve spool files are very large, they may
have more than a million lines, a set of tools is necessary for
working with such kind of files. SPOOL_BITE is one of the tools.
It "bites" the file and returns a portion.

   Usage:  spool_bite spool_file (-d <database> | -glo | -bas |
           -ove |  -sou ) [-o <output_file>]

     where spool_file -- is the name of the spool file which Solve
   generated. Then one of the option should follow:

     -d <database>  -- extract the portion of spool file with listing
                       for this database. Database name should be in
                       the same syntax as it appears in arc-file.

     -glo           -- section of the spool file with the estimates
                       of global parameters will be extracted and
                       written to the output file.

     -bas           -- section of the spool file with baseline
                       statistics will be extracted and written into
                       the output file.

     -ove           -- section of the spool file with overall
                       statistics will be extracted and written into
                       the output file.

     -sou           -- section of the spool file with source
                       statistics will be extracted and written into
                       the output file.

     -o <output_file>  -- sets the name of the output file. If the
                          output_file is omitted then SPOOL_BITE
                          write its output in /tmp/out.spl . It the
                          output filename is '-' then correlations
                          are written in standard output device
                          (screen).

  NB: you can specify only one option.
