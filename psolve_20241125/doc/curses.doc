		Curses Library Routines and Their Use
			Mark Hayes   NVI/GSFC
			   February 8,1993


The Curses library routines described below can be found in the library
file, /data2/mk3/src/solve/curlib/curlib.a on leo.  In order to use them,
a copy of that library file should be invoked in your make file.  The make
file also must invoke the HP-UX curses library by including -lcurses at
the end of the fc or cc line.


addstr_f:	character*(*) string
		call addstr_f(string)

	Writes the given string to the standard window. (Note: does not
	include a newline at the end)

beep_mn:	call beep_mn

	Issues a beep from the monitor.

blink_on_mn, blink_off_mn:	call blink_on_mn
					.
					.
				call blink_off_mn

	Text written to the standard window between the two calls will blink 
	on and off.

clear_mn:	call clear_mn

	Clears the standard window.

clrtobot_mn:	call clrtobot_mn

	Clears the standard window from the current cursor position to the
	bottom.

clrtoeol_mn:	call clrtoeol_mn

	Clears from the cursor to the end of the current line on the standard
	window.

deleteln_mn:	call deleteln_mn

	Deletes the line containing the cursor from the standard window.

end_mn:		call end_mn

	Ends window mode.  Should be called after the last curses call.

getstr_f:	character*(*) string
		call getstr_f(string)

	Reads a string from the keyboard, with termination signalled by a
	carriage return.

nl_mn:		call nl_mn

	Writes a newline character (CR/LF) to the standard window.

refresh_mn:	call refresh_mn

	Writes the current contents of the standard window to the screen.
	This routine must be called in order for text written to the standard
	window to appear on the screen, unless there is a call to getstr_mn,
	senkr_mn or senxy_mn.

reverse_on_mn, reverse_off_mn:	call reverse_on_mn
					.
					.
				call reverse_off_mn

	Turns inverse video attribute on and off.  Any text written to the 
	standard window between the two calls will be displayed in inverse
	video.

senkr_mn:	integer*4 x,y,ikey
		call senkr_mn(x,y,ikey)

	Returns screen coordinates when a non-arrow key is struck, as well
	as the character typed.  The character is returned in the low order
	byte of ikey.  Arrow keys may be used to position the cursor, and
	will not be picked up by this routine.

senxy_mn:	integer*4 x,y
		call senxy_mn(x,y)

	Same as senkr_mn, except that the typed character is not returned.

setcr_mn:	integer*4 x,y
		call setcr_mn(x,y)

	Positions the cursor at the specified coordinates.  (0,0) is the
	upper left corner of the screen.

setscrreg_mn:	integer*4 top,bot
		call setscrreg_mn(top,bot)

	Sets scrolling region of the standard window.  Scrolling will occur
	only for the region between lines top and bot, inclusively.  This
	is equivalent to locking the portion of the screen outside the range
	top to bot.

start_mn:	call start_mn

	Initializes things for curses routines; should be called only once,
	before any other curses calls.
