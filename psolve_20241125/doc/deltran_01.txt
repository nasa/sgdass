set_deltran  version 1.0  of  2001.12.20

   Program SET_DELTRAN  creates an intermediate file for importing    
   delays from the database to the current Solve scratch area         
   provided that this database and current Solve scratch area belong  
   to the same experiment. This trick is used for investigation of    
   subtle differences between two versions (revisions) of a database  
   file obtained by different fringing.                               
                                                                      
   set_deltran reads a pair of X/S databases and puts in the          
   intermediate file some information: group and phase delays, delay  
   date, suppression status etc.                                      
                                                                      
   This intermediate file is later used by program USE_DELTRAN which  
   is invoked by Solve in so-called user program mode.                
                                                                      
   Usage: set_deltran <database_name>'
