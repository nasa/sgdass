   Program  EOP_ALIGNMENT is for computing right hand side of
   NO_NET_rotation/translation constraint equations of global VLBI
   solutions in order to eliminate relative shift and drift of polar
   motion and UT1 time series with respect to IERS C04 series.

   Usage: eop_alignment &lt;sol-file&gt; &lt;nn-cons-list&gt; &lt;IERS-C04-file&gt;
 
   &lt;sol-file&gt; -- generic name of the output files obtained from
                 parsing spool file with using program getpar.
   &lt;nn-cons-list&gt; -- List of NNT-POS constraints used in solution.
                     This list can be found in Spool file just before
                     the section of global parameters. Cut this list,
                     put it into the file and feed if eop_alignment.
   &lt;IERS-C04-file&gt; -- external EOP file in IERS C04 format as it
                      was 2002.05.20

     eop_alignment writes right hand side of constraint equations in
   the screen. Just copy these lines and insert them to your Batch
   control file. If your previous solution had zero net-rotation,
   net-translation constraints, the new solution will have zero
   shift and drift with respect to IERS C04. Station position and
   velocity will be reciprocally changed with respect to the previous
   solution, of course.

   1) Compute the difference between EOP from the Solve solution
      with zero right part and IERS C04. Compute weighted secular
      drift and the shift with respect to IERS C04 at the reference
      epoch for which station positions in this solution were
      obtained.
 
   2) Compute the right hand side of constraint equations.
 
      Shift and drift of EOP series with respect to a reference is
      equivalent to a net-translation/rotation of station positions
      and velocity field. It can be written as:
 
      M * T = D
 
      where M -- matrix of dimension 3*6
      (N_pos -- total number of station position, N_vel -- total
       number of station velocity. If a station had an episodic
       motion, than its position is counted twice) in the form
 
       1  0  0   0    r3  -r2
       0  1  0  -r3   0    r1
       0  0  1   r2  -r1   0
 
    ... station 2, station 3 ... station N_pos
 
    0  0  0   0    0    0    1  0  0   0    r3  -r2    \
    0  0  0   0    0    0    1  0  0  -r3   0    r1     | Station 1
    0  0  0   0    0    0    1  0  0   r2  -r1   0     /
 
    ... station 2, station 3 ... station N_vel
 
     T -- 6-dimensional vector of transformation: translation and
          rotation;
     D -- 3-dimensional vector of station displacements due to
          a transformation.
 
     Summing over all station (if a station had an episodic motion,
   than its position is counted twice) we get the system of linear
   algebraic equations:
 
     Sum_i ( M_i * T = D_i )
 
   LSQ solution of this problem will be in the form
 
   T' = ( Sum_i Sum_j M_i * M_j )^-1 * Sum_i (M_i * D_i) (j&lt;=i)
 
   We can re-write this equation as
 
   Sum_i (M_i * D_i) =  ( Sum_i Sum_j M_i * M_j ) * T' (j&lt;=i)
 
   This is just the equation of net-rotation,net-translation
   constraint used in Solve. Setting the vector T' to the shift
   between the EOP series
 
           /  X_shift  \
     T' = |  -Y_shift   |
           \  UT1_shit /
 
     we compute the right hand-side of constraint equation for
   net-translation/net-rotation.
 
   Analogously we compute right hand-side of constraint equation for
   net-translation/net-rotation for velocities. But in summing the
   stations with episodic motion are counted only once.
 
 
   Caveat: the present version assumes that all stations which
           participated in no-net-translation constraitns for
           positions participated in no-net-translation for velicity
           and no-net-rotation for both position and velocity.
