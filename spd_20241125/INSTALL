Installation instruction for the SPD (Slanted Path Delay) software.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SPD was tested under Linux and MAC OS (Darwin) operating systems.

SPD is written in Fortran90. It was tested with Intel Fortran 
compiler version 13.0.1 and with GNU gfortran version 4.8.2.

Dependencies:

-- petools   -- a toolkit that has many useful routines for
                scientific computations. Available at
                http://astrogeo.org/petools

-- malo      -- MAss LOading software. Available at
                http://astrogeo.org/malo

-- blas      -- A library of Basic Linear Algebra routines. This library
                is tuned highly optimized for the specific processor.
                SPD uses the BLAS library that was configured with
                petools. Currently, petools supports two BLAS 
                implementations: ATLAS and Intel MKL. When you configure
                petools, you have to select one of the implementations.

-- lapack    -- A linear algebra library. If you configure petools with
                Intel MKL, you do not need an additional lapack library,
                since Intel MKL contains both BLAS and lapack. However,
                if you configured petools with ATLAS, you need to compile
                lapack library. Please refer to installation instructions
                below.

-- netcdf    -- Multi-platform database handler version 4.0 or newer.
                Available at http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf

-- hdf4      -- Another multi-platform database handler 
                Available at http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/products/hdf4

-- z         -- zlib. Usually, it is a part of the Operating System
                Available at http://www.zlib.net/
                NB: SPD requires 32-bit version of zlib

-- jpeg      -- jpeg6b library. Usually, it is a part of the Operating System
                Available at http://www.ijg.org/
                NB: SPD requires 64-bit version of jpeg
