`configure' configures this package to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...


Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
      --debug             run configuration in a verbose mode suitable for debugging

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [$HOME]
Optional Features:
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]

Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --without-pgplot        do not compile pgplot

  --without-blas          do not use external blas. A stub blas library will be 
                          compiled in

  --with-blas=[libraries name] -- specifies the string used in link time 
                                  for linking BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra
                                  Subroutines) linrary.

  --with-readline=[dir name]   -- specifies the directory name where readline 
                                  library is installed, in a case if it is not 
                                  a UNIX standard directory.

  --with-ncurses=[dir name]    -- specifies the directory name where ncurses 
                                  library is installed, in a case if it is not 
                                  a UNIX standard directory.

  --with-zlib=[dir name]       -- specifies the directory name where zlib
                                  library is installed, in a case if it is not 
                                  a UNIX standard directory.

  --with-png=[dir name]       -- specifies the directory name where png
                                  library is installed, in a case if it is not 
                                  a UNIX standard directory.

  --with-pgplot_tarball=[file name] -- specifies the name of the tarball file with 
                                       pgplot library.

  --with-local=[file name]     -- specifies the name of the file with local
                                  preferences

  --bits=[32|64]               -- specifies, whether to compile 32 bit 
                                  version or 64 bit version.

  --debug                      -- prints debugging information during configurtation

  --noopt                      -- disables all optimizations. May be useful for 
                                  debugging since more checks are imposed in
                                  non-optimized mode.

X features:
  --x-includes=DIR    X include files are in DIR
  --x-libraries=DIR   X library files are in DIR

Some influential environment variables that are honored:

  FC          Fortran compiler command
  CC          C compiler command
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
