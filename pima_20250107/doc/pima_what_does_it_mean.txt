Pima (plural pimy) is a dialect word in Russian language that 
describes a winter boot that is suitable when outside temperature
is in a range -20C, -60C. This word is used in Siberia and north-west
of Russia. There are two kinds of pima:

1) a high boot with deer fur outside. This is a kind of boots that
   are used by indigenous nations of the north of Siberia.

2) a high boot made from a 1cm thick layer of felt. This is a traditional 
   winter boot used by Russians and is called valenok (plural valenki).
