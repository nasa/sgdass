  Control file for PIMA consists of lines of variable length. Lines which
starts from characters # or * are considered as comments and ignored by
parsing software. Each line consists of a keyword and the value. All
keywords must be specified, no defaults are allowed. A value should be
separated from the keyword by one or more blanks. The first line and
the last of the control file should have the label of the format version.
The current label version is
 
# PIMA_CONTROL file.  Format Version of 2015.09.01
 
  If the file does not have correct format label, PIMA will issue
an errors message and stop. New keywords may be added in the future.
PIMA control files may require an upgrade if the control file
satisfies specifications of the old version of PIMA, but it misses
some keywords added in the newer version. An upgrade of control file

     NO      -- no measured calibration is applied.
 
     USE_ONE -- to apply one tone per intermediate frequency (IF).
                If two tone are available, then the tone with the
                lowest frequency will be applied. If more than two
                phase calibration tones are available, then the tone
                with index equal to the ratio of the total number of
                phase cal tones per IF will be applied. The phase

                with appropriate sign from cross-correlation
                phases in every spectral channels of a given IF.
 
     USE_ALL -- to apply all tones per intermediate frequency (IF).
                PIMA computes group delay and phase delay in phase
                calibration signal. Using these two values,
                it computes ph-cal phase for every spectral channel
                in the IF and then subtracts them  with an appropriate

                channels of a given IF.
 
  tone_index -- to apply one tone per intermediate frequency (IF).
                The value of tone_index sets the index of the phase
                calibration tone. If the index is out of range,
                then the tone with index equal to the ratio of the
                total number of phase cal tones per IF will be applied.
 
  The value may has an optional qualifier for fine-grained station selection.
  The qualifier is separated from the value with a column. Sub-value
  action can be TO_USE or NOT_TO_USE. A column separated list of
  stations follows the action sub-value. The action is case insensitive.
  Either column or comma can be used as a separation in the station list.
  If action is TO_USE, then pcal only from the stations form the list will
  be considered for using. If action is NOT_TO_USE, then pcal from the
  stations on the list will not be used. If phase calibbration for
  a given station is not available or was deselected with task gean pcal_off,
  then fine-grained phase calibration will have no effect. Task gean
  pcal_off has a precedence over fine-grained selection.

  This keyword controls the name of the polarization bandpass file.
In a case of dual-polarization data PIMA supports two bandpasses.
The first bandpass is for RR data. It is defined in the file specified
by BANDPASS_FILE name. The second bandpass determines the complex
function of frequency that describes the ration of complex response
of LL band with respect to RR. That second bandpass is specified by
POLARCAL_FILE. Therefore, the LL bandpass is the product of these
two bandpasses. When PIMA calibrates RR data, it uses only the first
bandpass. When PIMA calibrates LL data, it uses the product of two
bandpasses. When PIMA calibrates data for polarization I, which it
computes on the fly, it uses both bandpasses. POLARCAL_FILE is not
used for single-polarization data. Bandpass file name is an
output parameter for task bpas. Therefore, it may not exist for this
task. The bandpass file name is an input parameters for many other
tasks, such as frib, splt, mkdb. PIMA checks whether the specified

  This keyword controls the name of the mask file. Mask file consists

defines 4 masks: 1) for autocorrelation; 2) for computation of bandpass;
3) for fringe fitting, and 4) for task splt. Normally mass 2-3-4 are
the same. When PIMA processes autocorrelation, it multiplies
autocorrelation data by the mask value 0 and 1. Then it interpolates
the autocorrelation and puts on place those spectral channels that
were masked out (i.e. had 0 in the mask file) the value computed by
interpolation between neighboring channels that were not masked out.
When PIMA processes cross correlation data, it multiplies visibilities
on mask values. If a given channels is masked out, it is effectively
excluded from further processing.
 
  Bandpass mask file must define mask values for all spectral channels,
all IFs, all stations. PIMA supports task bmge (Bandpass Mask GEneration)
that allows to describe in an ascii files only those spectral channels,
IFs or their ranges that have to be masked out. Task bmge reads the

  Normally, the a priori interferometric model is defined inside
the FITS-IDI data. However, some correlators omit these sections
in FITS-IDI files, which prevents astrometry and geodetic applications
that require computation of the total phases, group delays, phase
delay rates and group delay rates. As a workaround PIMA supports
import of interferometric models in the form that were used by
the correlator. Keyword INTMOD_FILE specifies a file or a directory
tree(s) that contains files with the a priori model for path delay.
Interpretation of files depends on the correlator. In a case of
VERA hardware correlator in Mitaka, PIMA searches for files
that has "ANT." pattern and ignores all others. In a case of
SFXC correlator, PIMA searches for files with extension ".del"

<A NAME="section4"> </A> 4 &nbsp; Baseline fringe fitting keywords
</B></BIG></CENTER><LISTING> <FONT SIZE=4>
 
  The baseline fringe fitting procedure is the main task of PIMA.
The goal of the fringe fitting procedure is to find group delay,
group delay rate, phase delay rate and possibly phase delay
acceleration in such a way that would minimize the loss of coherency
during averaging over time and frequency.
 
  Baseline fringe fitting is done for each observation independently.
It consists of two steps: coarse fringe search and refinement.
In general, optimal determination of group delay, group delay rate,
phase delay rate and phase delay acceleration is a non-linear
procedure. The goal of the mandatory coarse fringe search is to find
an approximate value of group delay and phase delay rate in order
to shrink the search area and make possible linear estimator.
 
  PIMA supports several algorithms of fine search that improves
result of the coarse fringe search. Results of fringe search and
statistics of residuals are written in the ascii output files
defined by keywords FRINGE_FILE and FRIRES_FILE.

              The autocorrelation spectrum is corrected for sampling
              distortion. This is done by transforming the spectrum to
              the time domain, applying the digital sampler correction
              that may differ from the digital sampler correction of
              cross-correlator data since the autocorrelation data have
              much larger amplitude, normalizing the autocorrelation
              function to 1 at the zero lag and transforming the
              corrected autocorrelation data back to the spectral
              domain. Then the mean autocorrelation spectrum over an
              IF is computed for each station, and the cross-correlation
              visibilities are divided by the square root of the
              product of the mean autocorrelation spectrum for both
              stations of the baseline.

  There are three factors that reduces fringe amplitude when we observe
a source that is off the main beam. The first factor is due to data loss
at the edge of a frame with raw voltage record due to shifting of data
streams. If the frame has N points, we can cross-multiplies all N points
of both streams when no shift is applied. If one of the streams is
shifted at K points, we can cross-multiply only N-K points and the
amplitude of the average will become less by the (N-K)/N factor.
This factor is linear with respect to the group delay delay and the
amplitude is reduced by the factor of 0.5 at the edge of the natural
search window determined as a quantity reciprocal to the spectral
resolution. The second factor is the power pattern of the primary beam.
The third factor is appearance of the phase acceleration due to
the third derivative of path delay over time, two times, and over
source coordinates.

  Oversampling factor over group delay axis. When PIMA grids the data
for fringe search, it can reduce the step of the grid and pad the
samples between grid points. When no oversampling is used, the
amplitude of the coarse fringe may by less by a factor of 2.5 when
the maximum happens just between grid points. The week sources may be
overlooked. When the oversampling factors are 4 for both group delay
and phase delay rate, the amplitude drop of the coarse fringe search
is only 5%. It should be noted that the amplitude is affected by
the coarse fringe search only. If the sources is detected by the coarse
fringe search, the fine fringe fitting corrects the amplitude
underestimation.

FRIB.FINE_SEARCH:             [LSQ or ACC or PAR or BIN or TEC or NO]

  This keyword specifies the algorithm for fine fringe fitting that
follows the coarse fringe fitting.
 
  LSQ -- the parameters following parameters are determined with
         least square: group delay, group delay rate, phase delay
         rate, and fringe phase at the fringe reference time and
         the reference frequency. The reference frequency is the
         lowest frequency of the data that are processed.
         Fringe phase for each visibility point is assigned
         according the the a priori SNR. The algorithm
         seeks the variance factor that corrects the a priori weights
         in such a way that the ratio of the weighted sum of the
         postfit residuals to its mathematical expectation be close
         to unity. The algorithm computes these reweighting parameters
         for two cases: multiplicative reweighting and additive
         reweighting, i.e. in the the first case the a posteriori
         weight is the a priori weight multiplied by the reweighting
         parameter, and in the second case the a posteriori weight
         is the a priori weight with the reweighted parameter added
         in quadrature. The algorithm returns three estimates of
         group delay, group delay rate, phase delay rate, phase and
         amplitude of observation-averaged visibilities: without
         reweighting, with multiplicative reweighting and with additive
         reweighting.
 
  ACC -- the same as LSQ, but phase delay acceleration is evaluated
         instead of group delay rate.
 
  PAR -- the fine fringe fitting is done by the parabolic fit
         through three points of the delay resolution function around
         the maxima. The search of the maxima is performed separately
         for delay and delay rate. The Lagrange interpolating
         polynomial is computed, and the linear equation which
         equalizes the derivative to zero is solved. The algorithm
         returns the estimates of group delay, phase delay rate, phase
         and amplitude of observation-averaged visibilities.
 
  BIN -- the fine fringe fitting is done by binary division method.
         The algorithm returns the estimates of group delay, group
         delay rate, phase delay rate, phase and amplitude of
         observation-averaged visibilities.
 
  TEC -- not implemented

  This parameter controls computation of the mean amplitude

time an over frequency is analyzed for a search of the signal
from the radio source. The result is analyzed also for determination
of the mean amplitude of the noise. Among the results of the
2D Fourier transform the minimum among 32768 or 1/2 of the
number of elements are randomly selected. The amplitudes
of these random points of the spectrum are sorted in
the ascending order. Then the iterative procedure for
outlier elimination is launched. If the amplitude of the top
point of the list is greater than FRIB.NOISE_NSIGMA times the
root mean square over amplitudes in the list, the point is
discarded, the root means squares is recomputed, and the
procedure is repeated. Outlier elimination is made mainly to
eliminate from statistics computation those points that are

  Sets the threshold for detection. Observations with the SNR
less than this threshold are considered as non-detections.
Task splt discards observations with the SNR less than this
threshold. Task mkdb set flag "non-detection" for observations
with the SNR below this threshold. The detection limit depends
on the number of visibility data used for fringe fitting. PIMA
cannot determine the a priori threshold. It is set by a user.
It is possible to determine the SNR detection limit by analyzing
statistics of residuals from observations of the same type.
The SNR is defined as the ratio of the fringe amplitude to
the mean value of amplitude of noise. If to consider that
real and image part of noise are independent and have Gaussian
distribution with variance \sigma, the mean amplitude is
\sqrt(\pi/2) \approx 1.253 \sigma. The variance of the amplitude
noise is \sqrt(2 - \pi/2} \approx 0.655 \sigma.

  The mode of the complex bandpass computation procedure. This
keyword specifies the stage where bandpass computation should stop.
There are three stages for bandpass calculation.
 
  INIT  -- to run the bandpass in the init mode. PIMA analyzes the
           input file with the fringe fitting results and finds
           the observations with the maximum SNR for each baseline
           with the reference station. NB: PIMA obeys INCLUDE_OBS:
           and EXCLUDE_OBS: keywords and checks only those observations
           that satisfies the filter. PIMA computes the visibilities
           averaged over time with parameters of fringe fitting
           applies. These time-averaged visibilities are a function of
           frequency. The phase of the complex bandpass is the residual
           phase of the visibilities after subtraction the time and
           frequency averaged phase over the observation. The amplitude
           of the bandpass is the amplitude of time-averaged visibility
           after dividing it over the amplitude averaged over time and
           frequency within the IF to which the individual point of the
           bandpass belongs. The bandpass can be considered as the
           averaged visibility. The normalization for phase is computed
           by averaging over all IFs, and normalization for amplitude
           is computed by averaging over individual IFs. In the case of
           dual-polarization data when POLAR: I is specified, the
           procedure is repeated twice: first for the RR polarization
           bandpass second for the LL polarization with respect to the
           RR polarization data.
 
  ACCUM -- to run bandpass in the accumulation mode. After computation
           the bandpass in the init mode, the bandpass is applied to
           K observations at every baseline with the reference station.
           PIMA selects these observations as the ones that have the
           greatest SNR.
 
  FINE  -- to run bandpass in the fine mode. After  computation the
           bandpass in the accumulation mode, the bandpass is re-computed
           using least squares. Accumulation bandpass is applied.
           Correction to the accumulation bandpass is computed by
           estimating parameters of the phase and amplitude bandpass
           using M observations with the highest SNR among all
           baselines with the references station. Estimated parameters
           for the phase part are coefficients of expansion over Legendre
           polynomials of B-spline basis. Estimated parameters for
           the amplitude part are coefficients of expansion of the
           logarithm of the residual amplitude ratios into either
           Legendre polynomials or the B-spline basis. After computing
           a solution, observations are checked for outliers. If the
           residual phases or amplitudes exceed a certain threshold, the
           observation is marked as outlier and the bandpass is recomputed.
           The procedure is repeated till either no outlier is found.
           If at a given baseline the number of remaining observations
           fell to the specified threshold Q, no more outliers at that
           baseline is eliminated.

  This keyword specifies the minimum time decorrelation value computed

0 to 1. DECOR_TIM is the ration of the correlated amplitude coherently
averaged over the scan to the arithmetic average (i.e. the incoherent
average) of the correlated amplitude computed over elementary segments
used by the procedure of fine fringe fitting. DECOR_TIM is close to 1
for a perfect observation. Phase variations due to atmosphere of
frequency standard degrades DECOR_TIM. This degradation is harmless
for bandpass calculation. However, DECOR_TIM may be reduced due to
catching artificial signal, either internal or external RFI. The
purpose of this filter is to prevent using observations affected
by RFI. Recommended value: 0.8 at frequencies below 15 GHz and 0.5
at frequencies above 15 GHz. Value 0.0 disables this filter entirely.

   ONE     -- all weights are unity.
 
   OBS_SNR -- Calibrated amplitude is computed over the observation.
              The SNR for a given IF is computed based on the SNR
              over the observation. Rms of noise is computed as
              a ratio of calibrated amplitude to the SNR over the
              IF. Weight is reciprocal to the square of noise
              rms. Thus, the weight is computed for a given IF
              using all accumulation periods of the observation.
 
   OBS_RMS -- Weighted variance of calibrated visibilities is computed
              for a given IF using all accumulation periods of a given
              observation. Weight is reciprocal to the variance.
 
   SEG_RMS -- Weighted variance of calibrated visibilities is computed
              for a given IF using all accumulation periods over
              a given segment. Weight is reciprocal to the variance.
 
   AUTO    -- If the number of accumulation periods per segment is
              greater of equal than the threshold (currently 8),
              WEIGHT_TYPE AUTO is equivalent to WEIGHT_TYPE: SEG_RMS.
              If the number of accumulation periods per segment is
              less than the threshold (currently 8), weighted variance
              of calibrated visibilities is computed over so-called
              "weights segments". These weight segments are longer than
              the output visibility segments. Weight for a given IF,

factors for given intermediate frequencies using only a part of the
bandwidth. Initially, the bandpass is normalized to unity over the
*entire* bandwidth of the IF. However, often decorrelation occurs at the
edges of the band. PIMA allows to specify the portion of the band that
is considered "representative". It is expressed in parameters Bl, Bh
that stands for bandwidth low range and bandwidth high range that are
specified in SPLT.BPASS_NRML_RANGE. The representative bandwidth is
[F_low + Bl*Fw, F_low*Bh*fw]. Renormalization factor
R = (sum B_r/N_r ) / Sum B_t/N_t, where B_r -- bandpass in the bandwidth
is [F_low + Bl*Fw, F_low*Bh*fw], N_r -- the number of points in that
bandwidth; B_t bandpass in the total bandwidth, N_t the total number of
points in the entire IF. The IF-dependent factors scale the bandpass
to make makes its normalized over the representative bandwidth within
a given IF [F_low + Bl*Fw, F_low*Bh*fw]. Usually, the factor is less

  These keyword specifies the range of the bandwidth as a share of
the nominal bandwidth that are considered representative for bandpass
renormalization. The parameters of the range are between [0,1].
The parameter is discarded when SPLT.BPASS_NRML_METHOD: NO.
If unsure, specify 0.2:0.8
 
  low  -- the low frequency of the IF that belongs to the
          representative range. Should be in a range [0, 1).
 
  high -- the high frequency of the IF that belongs to the
          representative range. Should be in a range (0,1].
          High should be greater than low.
 
Example: let the IF frequency range 32 MHz, the number of spectral
channels is 256. If SPLT.BPASS_NRML_RANGE: 0.2:0.75, then
the low frequency of the representative range is 0.2*32 = 6.4 MHz,
the first spectral channel within the range is 52. The high
frequency of the representative range is 0.75*32 = 24 MHz,
the last spectral channel within the range is 192. Thus the bandpass
renormalization will be done in such a way that the mean bandpass
over spectral channels with indices 52-192 be unity.

  NO   -- no gain correction will be applied
 
  file -- name of the gain correction file. It consists of records of fixed
          lengths in plain ascii. Each record defines gain correction, its
          formal errors and the number of observations used to derived for
          a specific station and specific IF. Task splt checks whether
          keyword SPLT.GAIN_CORR_FILE defines a file. If it does it multiplies
          visibility by the product of two gain corrections for each station
          of a baseline.

  This keyword specifies whether the station based or baseline based
algorithm for computation of averaged visibilities will be used.
Usually, station-based algorithm is required for imaging since
baseline based algorithm does not preserve phase misclosure.
However, station based algorithm prevents putting observations with
less than three baselines in the output FITS-IDI file. Therefore,
sometimes it is desirable to have a possibility to write the averaged
visibilities split into sources even of they belong to a subarray
with only two stations.
 
  YES -- to use a station-based algorithm for computing averaged
         visibilities. All observations that passed input filter
         controlled by keywords INCLUDE_OBS_FILE, EXCLUDE_OBS_FILE,
         OBS, and SNR_DETECTION_LIMIT are process for computation
         of station-based quantities. The same observations are
         used for generating the output.
 
  ALL -- to use a station-based algorithm for computing averaged
         visibilities. All observations that passed input filter
         controlled by keywords INCLUDE_OBS_FILE, EXCLUDE_OBS_FILE,
         OBS, and SNR_DETECTION_LIMIT are process for computation
         of station-based quantities. All observations between
         the station for which station-based group delays, phase
         delay rates, and group delays are used for generating
         the output <B>regardless</B> whether they passed the input
         filter or not. If unsure, specify ALL.
 
  NO  -- to use a baseline-based algorithm. Suitable mainly for
         processing single-baseline data.

  This keyword controls the logic for computation of scan reference
time (SRT). Since PIMA processes all observations independently,
in general, fringe reference time of observations of the same scan
is not the same. Group delays, phase delay rates, and fringe phases
of the same scan, the same subarray are referred to a common epoch
that is called scan reference time. PIMA computes this scan reference
time in such a way that the errors of group delays is minimized.
If unsure, use MID_SCAN.
 
  MID_SCAN -- PIMA finds the scan reference time near in the middle
              of a scan that. In a simplest case when all stations
              started and ended a scan at the same time and there
              were no data losses, the scan reference time is the
              middle scan epoch rounded to 1 sec. Computation of scan
              reference time is not trivial if good data started
              and ended at different stations at different epochs.
              First PIMA finds the interval of time of valid
              accumulation periods (AP) over all used observations
              of a scan. If it finds observations that are not in
              common range, it splits the scan into subarrays that
              are treated as separate scans. Then within each subarray
              it finds for each observation the range of time for
              which the formal uncertainty of group delay increases
              by no more than either an additive parameter
              MKDB.GD_MAX_ADD_ERROR and by no more than scaling factor
              MKDB.GD_MAX_SCL_ERROR. If it finds observations that are
              not in common range, it splits the scan into subarrays
              that are treated as separate scans. Finally, for each
              remaining subarray PIMA assigns the scan reference time
              that is in the middle of the common range, subject of
              constraints imposed on allowed increase of group delay
              formal uncertainty. The scan reference time is rounded
              to the nearest second.
 
  SRT_FRT  -- scan reference time is the same as fringe reference time.
              If this value is specified, the scan reference time
              may be different for each observation.
 
  file     -- name of the file with scan reference time. PIMA allows
              to compute the best fringe reference time externally
              and import it using MKDB.SRT keyword.
