STRUC_CONTROL  Format version of 2007.03.18
#
#  Control file for computation of source structure contribution to
#  phase and group delay. 
#
#  The file consists of two types of records:
#  1) Macro   definition
#  2) Source  definition
#
#  Format of macro definition records
#
#   1:3   A3    Record definition. Must be SET
#   5:    A     macro name
#    :    A     Value. If the value is {ENV}, then the actual value will be
#               taken from the environment variable with the macro name.
#
#  Format of source definition records
#
#   1:3   A3    Record definition. Must be SOU
#   6:15  A10   Source name
#  18:18  A1    Band identifier
#  21:28  A8    Usage. Supported keywords: 
#               MAP_FITS -- delay is used computed by Fourier transform of the map
#               DEL_COMP -- delay is computed from the source model in 
#                           the form of delta function (Clean components)
#               GAU_COMP -- delay is computed from the source model in 
#                           the form of Gaussian components
#               NONE     -- no source mape is used
#  31:49  A19   Begin date of the map validity
#  51:69  A19   End date of the map validity
#  72:79  F8.2  X pixel coordinate of the reference point with respect to the phase center
#  81:88  F8.2  Y pixel coordinate of the reference point with respect to the phase center
#  91:    A     File with the source map in fits format. The file name may 
#               contain macro strings with defied in the macro definition section
#               with leading dollar sign, using the same syntax as shell 
#               environment variables.
