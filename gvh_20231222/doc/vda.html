<H1> Description of the ascii geo-VLBI data format VGOSDA</H1>

<H2> Introduction </H2>

   Ascii geo-VLBI data format VGOSDA, of for short VDA, is designed for 
support of transferring VLBI Level-2 data between software packages and 
their editing. Since VDA is in plain ascii, development of a handler 
for reading/writing is a trivial 
task and does not require specialized skills of installation of specialized 
software. The VDA was derived from Mark-3 DBH format used in 1976&ndash;2018. 
A handler for VDA format was implemented in 2006 under name AGVF and 
incorporated into Solve software package. The library gvh that implements 
the handler is distributed also as a standalone package.
<P>

  Since VDA format is ascii, its parsing incurs certain overheads. It is
not recommended for adoption as am internal format for data analysis software
packages. The main use case of VDA format is a distribution of Level-2 data
and results of data analysis of a specific VLBI experiment for geodesy and
absolute astrometry between various data analysis software packages. Software
analysis packages are supposed to be able to transform from the VDA format
to their internal format and vice versus without loss of information.
<P>

  Level 2 VLBI data in the context of this document means results of fringe
fitting program in a form of total group delay, total phase delay rate, 
and the total phase. The datafile in VDA format contains also other
variables that describes the VLBI experiment and results of its analysis.

  In the context of this document a dataset that originates from processing
of indepndently scheduled  observations is called <B>experiment</B>. 
Experiment duration varies from 30 minutes to 15 days, althoug durations 
less than 1 hour and longer than 24 hours are unusual. During an experiment 
N stations observe M sources. Duration of time when an array or its part 
observes a given source before slewing to another source is called 
<B>scan</B>. Data collectated by a pair or stations during a scan is 
called <B>observation</B>.

<H1> Structure of an VDA file</H1>

  VDA file consists of records of variable length. Records consists
of ascii symbols with codes 32 though 255 (decimal). Characters with codes
128 to 255 are allowed but discouraged. A record consists of words separated
by one or more blanks. Records have a prefix in a form of a 4-character
long section ID followed by character <EM class="val">.</EM> (dot) followed 
by the chunk index.
<P>

A valid VDA file consists of the format label and one or more chunks.
Each chunk consists of 5 mandatory sections in the following order:

<UL>
    <LI> <B>FILE</B> section
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <B>PREA</B> (preamble) section
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <B>TOCS</B> (table of contents) section
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <B>DATA</B> section
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <B>HEAP</B> heap section. Always empty. Reserved for future use.
         </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>

   Sections <B>FILE</B>, <B>PREA</B>, and <B>TOCS</B> describe the data,
Section <B>DATA</B> presents the data. The data are considered as
a set of four-dimensional arrays of one of the types: CHARACTER*1, 
INTEGER*2,INTEGER*4, INTEGER*8, REAL*4, REAL*8 and of one of 
the classes: 
<EM class="cla">SES</EM>, <EM class="cla">SCA</EM>, 
<EM class="cla">STA</EM>, <EM class="cla">BAS</EM>. Fortran notation is 
used for describing arrays: a) dimensions starts from 1; b) the index 
over first dimension runs first, i.e. elements order is a(i,j), 
a(i+1,j), a(i+2,j) etc. The dimensions 3 and 4 depend on the class 
of the data.
<P>

   Throughout this document the strings that should be present in the 
VDA file are <EM class="val">highlighted</EM>. Examples that are 
not a part of definitions are also <EM class="pre">highlighted</EM>.
<P>
  
  For historical reasons an individual array of data is called LCODE.
An LCODE defines a 8-character long name, a string or arbitrary length 
with its description, class, type, and four dimensions. A class 
determines the scope of the LCODE and dimensions of the high level. 
Supported classes:
<P>

<UL>
    <LI> <EM class="cla">SES</EM> The scope of the LCODE is the 
                    entire experiment, f.e. instance the experiment 
                    name. The dimensions 3 and 4 are 1, 1.
		    </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="cla">SCA</EM> The scope of the LCODE is a given 
                    scan. The third dimension is the number of scans, 
                    the fourth dimension is 1.
		    </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="cla">STA</EM> The scope of the LCODE is a given 
                    station, for instance apriori clock delay used for 
                    correlation. The third dimension is the number of 
                    observations at a given station, the fourth dimension 
                    is the station index.
		    </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="cla">BAS</EM> The scope of the LCODE is a given 
                    observation, f.e. group delay. The third dimension is 
                    the total number of observations, the fourth dimension 
                    is 1.
		    </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>

  An LCODE can be defined only once. There are five mandatory LCODEs 
that should be defined at the beginning of the first chunk. The VDA
format does not regulate which other LCODEs should be present, in
which order, and in which chunk. The order of codes and their allocation
in the chunk is selected by the generating software.

<H3> VDA label</H3>

The VDA label a string of 64 characters long that identifies the format
and its revision. The VDA label is the first record of a valid 
VDA file.
<P>

Example:

<PRE class="pre">
VGOSDA Format of 2019.09.09
</PRE>

<H2> File section (FILE)</H2>

A record in the file section has two words. The first word is the 
record prefix <EM class="val">FILE</EM> and the chunk index separated by 
dot. Chunks are numbered starting from 1 consecutively. The second 
word is the the full path file name that contributed to the chunk. 
<P>

  Example:

<PRE class="pre">
FILE.1 /vlbi/gvf/db/20170117_pr1775_fr1_v001.bgv
</PRE>


<H2> Preamble section (PREA)</H2>

  Preamble section contains auxiliary information. A record of the
preamble sections has format Prefix Keyword Value Unit separated a blank.
Prefix has format: <EM class="val">PREA</EM> and the chunk index separated 
by dot. Unit can be empty. A preamble section of the first chunk has 
three mandatory keywords:

<UL>
    <LI> <EM class="val">@section_length:</EM> defines the number of 
         records in the preamble section except this one. This record 
         should be the first record of the section. The first word of 
         the Value is the number of records, the second is unit: keyword.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="val">GENERATOR:</EM> defines name and version of the 
         program that generated this section. Version number should be 
         defined in such a way that sorting it alphabetically corresponds 
         to sorting it chronologically.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="val">CREATED_AT:</EM> defines the creation date 
         in format YYYY.MM.DD-hh:mm:ss
         </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>

Example: 

<PRE class="pre">
PREA.1 @section_length:     15 keywords
</PRE>

<P>

  A preamble section of chunks others than the first has only one mandatory
keyword: @section_length. An empty preamble section must have value 0 
of this keyword.

<H2> Text section (TEXT)</H2>

   Text section consists of auxiliary information, for instance, 
correlation report, schedule file, etc. Non-ascii text, such as 
a document in pdf-format can be put in the text section after 
<A HREF="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648.html">base64</A>
encoding. Text section consists of one or more chapters. A chapter
is a portion of text. A record of the text sections has format Prefix 
Keyword Value. A keyword is allowed to be empty. 
<P>

  The first record of the text section defines the number of chapters.
This is a mandatory record. Format: Prefix Keyword Value Unit.

  In this example group delay for observation with index 4466
is shown. The group delay was defined as array with dimensions
2,1,4538,1 in the table of contents. The first dimension runs
over bands. The first value group delay corresponds to the 1st 
band and the second to 2nd band. The frequency of bands are 
determined in another LCODE (REF_FREQ in this case). The VDA
itself does not specity the unit of LCODE. Units are supposed 
to be defined in the LCODE description or in an external
document.

  In the last exanoke original value of lcode "blank eight" was
conveerted to "underscore eight" by writing routine. A reading
routine is supposed to understand _8 and determine that it is
equivalent to "blank eight".

<H2> Comments on using the VDA format</H2> 

  The VDA format provides sufficient flexibility to carry results
of fringe fitting, such as estimates of group delay, delay rate,
their formal uncertainties, etc (Level-2A) and results of geodetic 
preprocessing, such as flags, solution parameterization, correction
to weights, etc (Level-2B). VDA is not suitable to carry Level-1
data (raw results of correlation).
<P>

  Splitting an VDA file into chunks is for facilitating an interface
with other formats for Level-2 geodetic VLBI results. A valid VDA
file is supposed to have at least one chunk. Splitting data in 
chunks is determined by the generator process.
<P>

  Some data are station dependent, for instance cable calibration,
some are observation-dependent, for instance group delays. They
are stored differently. Array <TT>OBS_TAB</TT> stored at the LCODE 
with the same name determines relationship between observation index 
and the indices of station-dependent parameters. For an observation
with index <B>k</B> station-dependent LCODEs will have indices
<TT>OBS_TAB(2,k)</TT> for the 1st (i.e. reference) station of a baseline

  History of LCODE naming is traced in 70s. Renaming LCODEs is 
discouraged because of a risk of breaking compatibility. Addition
of new LCODEs carries a low risk.

<H2> Appendix </H2> 

  As an example, LCODEs for the experiment r1775 processed by PIMA are shown 
below. Only first five LCODEs are mandatory since are used by the handler
for processing other LCODEs. LCODEs are grouped into two categories: common
that originate from post-correlator analysis software or log-file parsing 
software that generates a Level-2A dataset and the data analysis specific
LCODEs. The LCODEs in the latter category is mainly from geodetic/astrometry 
data analysis software packages that processes a Level-2A dataset and generates
a Level-2B dataset (edited, reweighted, with parameterization stored).
