To install, use three commands:

./configure
make
make install

See ./configure --help for options

spd_client can be installed in two ways:

1) without dependencies to petools library and/or lapack;

   A user can specifies --without-petools and/or --without-lapack 
   in ./configure. In that case built-in routines will be used.

2) with dependencies to petools library. A user needs to specify 
   directory where petools is installed.

   --with-petools=DIR, where DIR is the petools installation directory.
                       NB: dependency on petools atomatically uses
                       lapack library used to build petools.

NB: if spd_client was configured without petools it cannot be used
by other packages that require petools, such as VTD, MALO, PIMA.
Use configuration without petools only if you plan to use spd_client
for the applications that do not require petools.
