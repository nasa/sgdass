Description of the format of total visibilities written by
VLBI data analysis software program PIMA, task splt when 
keyword SPLT.TOTAL_UV: has value YES.

I. Introduction:
================

File withe the total visibilities consists of records of
variables lengths in plain ascii coding. Lines that start with
# character are considered as comments and ignored.

The field line of the valid file with total visibilities is supposed
to define the format version. The current supported version is

# Total fringe phases and amplitudes. Format  1.00 Version of 2020.04.18

The file consists of records of two type: IF records that contain
visibilities averaged over time and frequency within a given IF, and 
Band records that contain visibilities averaged over time and frequency 
within the entire band.

II. Format of IF records:
=========================

  Each IF record starts with "Sou:".

   1:4    A4     Record ID. Always Sou:
   5:5    A1     Delimiter. Always blank
   6:15   A10    J2000 source name
  16:21   A6     Delimiter
  22:29   A8     IVS 8-character long name of the reference station of a baseline
  30:30   A1     Delimiter
  31:38   A8     IVS 8-character long name of the remote station of a baseline
  39:50   A12    Delimiter

  74:83   A11    Delimiter
  84:88   I5     Internal PIMA observation index
  89:96   A8     Delimiter
  97:98   I2     IF index
  99:106  A8     Delimiter
 107:107  I1     Polarization index
 108:114  A7     Delimiter
 115:128  F14.7  Fringe amplitude in Jy. If GAIN: NO was specified, then dimensionless
 129:136  A8     Delimiter
 137:145  F9.6   Fringe phase referred to the band reference frequency in rad
 146:151  A6     Delimiter
 153:161  F9.2   SEFD in Jy
 162:166  A5     Delimiter
 167:179  D13.6  U-coordinate at the band reference frequency. Dimensionless
 180:180  A1     Delimiter
 181:193  D13.6  V-coordinate at the band reference frequency. Dimensionless


II. Format of band records:
===========================
