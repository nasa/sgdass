<EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> was designed to be "scriptable", i.e. called from 
another programs. The interface: control file that have to define all parameters, 
task and command line arguments that override the keywords defined in the 
control file is somewhat heavy weight. <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> distribution
provides 4 scripts and users are encouraged to develop their own. These scripts 
are also called wrappers, because they wrap calls to various 
<EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> tasks.

  The wrappers do not provide new functionality that <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM>
does not have. They significantly simplify the user interface by expense 
of reducing functionality and by imposing rules on file names. If you need 
full functionality, for instance for processing unusual experiment, 
<EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> wrappers will not work for you. But the use of 
wrappers may be sufficient for processing many experiments.
<P>
Wrappers assume the file names obey the following convention:
<UL>
     <LI> <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> control files are located in directory 
          <TT>VVVVV/EEE</TT>, where <TT>VVVVV</TT> is the root directory of 
          vlbi experiments specified by --pima-exp-dir  during 
          configuration and <TT>EEE</TT> is the experiment name specified 
          in the keyword <EM class="com">SESS_CODE</EM> of the 
          <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> control file. 
</UL> 

<P>

The following wrappers are provided:

<UL>
     <LI><EM class="wrap">pf.py</EM> &mdash; Fringe fitting. Includes tasks 
         data loading, parse log files, coarse fringe fitting, bandpass 
         computation, fine fringe fitting, data calibration and splitting, 
         generation of the output database in GVF format, auto-imaging, 
         generation of image pictures, etc.
         </LI><P>

   The wrapper has general options followed by three mandatory positional 
arguments followed by task specific optional arguments. General options that 
follow immediately after the wrapper name and before positional arguments:

         have been interrupted, when <EM class="wrap">pf.py</EM> 
         is invoked with <EM class="com">-resume</EM> flag, it will examine 
         fringe file and fringe residual file. It will search backward the 
         latest full record and then restart with the next observation.
         If the last record is corrupted, f.e. was written only
         partially, <EM class="wrap">pf.py</EM> will discard the corrupted record.
         prints commands that it is about to execute, but does not execute 
         them.
         </LI><P>

     <LI><EM class="com">-s</EM> &mdash; to use static build of 
             <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM>. The directory of the static build
             is defined in pima_local.py. This option may be useful when you
             have several versions of <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM>.
         </LI><P>

     <LI><EM class="com">[opts]</EM> &mdash; additional options. Some

            Wrapper <EM class="wrap">pf.py</EM> may override values
            of some keywords defined in the control file. Values 
            of the keywords defined at the end of the wrapper command
            line have the highest priority and override the values set
            by the wrapper.
         </LI><P>
</UL>

   There are three mandatory arguments:
<P>
<UL>
     <LI><EM class="com">exp</EM> &mdash; experiment name in low case.
         </LI><P>

     <LI><EM class="com">band</EM> &mdash; band name in the low case.

</UL>

   Supported tasks:
<P>
<UL>
    <LI> <EM class="task">load</EM> [<EM class="com">-nopcal</EM>] &mdash; 
         loading a database into internal <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM>
         data structures. This task searches for <TT>SSSSS/EEE_uv.exc</TT> 
         file. If such a file exists, it purges its contents. If during 
         executing <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> task <EM class="task">load</EM>
         it finds that there are bad points, and the keyword 
         <EM class="com">UV_EXCLUDE_FILE:</EM> <EM class="val">AUTO</EM>,
         it runs the this task the second time, and if necessary,
         the second time. Option <EM class="com">-nopcal</EM> instructs
         <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> not to load phase calibration.
         <P>
         This task creates log file <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_load.log</TT>.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="task">logs</EM> &mdash; searches for all log files 
         in VVVVV/EEE directory, parses them and writes down in PIMA
         ANTAB format. This task assumes log names are either in
         IVS format: <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEElog.SS</TT> format, or VLBA format: 
         <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEESS.log</TT>, or in KVN format: 
         <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEEKK.log</TT>, where SS is a two character long 
         station code, KK is a three character long name of a KVN 
         station: one of KTN, KUS, or KYS. The output file has format 
         <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_SS.ant</TT>. This  task creates log file
         <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_log_antab.log</TT>.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="task">gean</EM> &mdash; this task searches for log
         files in PIMA ANTAB format generated, for example, by wrapper 
         task <EM class="task">logs</EM> and/or for legacy VLBI log
         file, parses them and loads system temperature, cable calibration
         atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity into 
         internal data structure of <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM>. It searches 
         for </I>parsed</I> log files in PIMA ANTAB format with file names
         <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_SS.ant</TT> and/or VLBA legacy log with
         name <TT>VVVVVV/EEE/EEEcal.vlba</TT>. When the tasks processes
         legacy VLBA logs, it loads phase calibration phase and amplitude
         as well as cable calibration. NB: Legacy log files should 
         <I>not</I> be used for processing VLBA experiments recorded with 
         a digital backend since 2014. If FITS-IDI files had calibration
         information, task <EM class="task">gean</EM> overwrites it.
         This  task creates log file <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_gean.log</TT>. 
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="task">coarse</EM> &mdash; this task performs fringe
         search in the coarse mode. The goal of performing coarse fringe 
         search is a) to identify failures; b) to find a list of high SNR
         scans. Coarse fringe search runs in a simplified mode in order
         to speed up computations. No bandpass calibration, no bandpass
         mask, no phase calibration mask, no oversampling is applied.
         Fringe fit uses single polarization data. Fine fringe fits 
         algorithm uses a simplistic parabolic fit. The task generates
         the output file with fringe fitting results with name 
         <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_nobps.fri</TT> and fringe fitting residuals
         with name <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_nobps.frr</TT> overriding names
         specified in the control file by keywords 
         <EM class="com">FRINGE_FILE</EM> and <EM class="com">FRIRES_FILE</EM,
         though trailing options of <EM class="wrap">pf.py</EM> still can
         override these names. The task creates log file with name
         <TT>VVVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_coarse.log</TT>.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> <EM class="task">bpas</EM> &mdash; this task performs computation
          of the bandpass and, in a case of dual-polarization data, 
          polarization bandpass. This task has two modes: inspection mode
          that is invoked with option <EM class="com">-insp</EM> and 
          production mode. The task in the inspection mode computes bandpass 
          in the <EM class="com">init</EM> mode. It generates two plots 
          for observations with the maximum SNR with at all baselines
          with the reference stations. The first plot shows normalized 
          amplitude (green), a model fit to the normalized amplitude (blue), 
          and amplitude of auto-correlation (red). The second plot shows
          residual phases (green) and the model fit to residual phases 
          (blue). The task invoked in the inspection node creates a bandpass 
          with name <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_init.bps</TT> and, if dual-band data
          are processed, the polarization bandpass with name
          <TT>VVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_init_plr.bps</TT> as well. 
          <P>
 
          When task is invoked in the production mode, i.e. without using 
          <EM class="com">-insp</EM> option, it computes the bandpass,
          and polarization.

         </LI><P>
    <LI> <EM class="task">fine</EM> &mdash; runs fringe fitting
          in the fine mode. Unless option <EM class="cal">-keep</EM> is
          specified, this task will purge fringe file and fringe residual
          file if they exist before processing the first observation. 
          Option <EM class="cal">-keep</EM> suppresses deletion of 
          existing fringe file and fringe residual files.
          The list of observations to be processed is determined by 
          keywords <EM class="cal">OBS, INCLUDE_OBS_FILE, 
          EXCLUDE_OBS_FILE</EM>
          <P>

    <LI> <EM class="task">gain</EM> &mdash; updates gain table into internal
         <EM class="pima">pima</EM> data structure. The task checks
         two files vlba_gains.key and ivs_gains.key in the share directory 
         specified by options <EM class="com">--pima-share</EM> during
         <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> installation. The task does not issue
         a message if it does not find gain information for one or more
         stations, since this situation is considered normal. However,
         if gain is missing for certain stations(s), observations at 
         baselines with such stations will not be used by task 
         <EM class="task">splt</EM>, and therefore, cannot contribute
         to imaging. 
         <P>
         This task <I>updates</I> the gain only for frequencies and 
         stations specified in the control file (<EM class="com"> BEG_FRQ, 
         END_FRQ, FRQ_GRP</EM> ) and found in the gain file. Gain for
         for other stations and/or other frequencies remains unchanged.
         <P>

         The task creates log file with name <TT>VVVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_gain.log</TT>.
         The log file contains information about gain information in
         <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> data structure after running this
         task. It is strongly advised to examine this log file to be
         sure that correct gain is applied.

    <LI> <EM class="task">splt</EM> &mdash; performs calibration of 
          visibilities for system temperature and gain; performs
          amplitude renormalization, applies results of fringe fitting,
          averages visibilities over time and frequencies, and writes
          calibrated and averaged visibilities into output files in
          FITS format.
          <P>

          The task creates log file with name <TT>VVVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_splt.log</TT>.

          the amplitude of the secondary maximum of 2D Fourier transform 
          that in the absence of phase distortion would be below the

VTD/Post-Solve interactive solution should be made first.

<TT>Q</TT>). The the spool file with residuals should be copied into file
<TT>VVVVVV/EEE/EEE_B_init.spl</TT>. An analyst should be check carefully 
the residual file. In particular, an analyst should check a) the experiment
name and band name :-); b) whether solution is correct (wrms of residuals
is close to what it is supposed to be); c) the spool file contains residuals.
Residual section starts after line <TT>Residuals from Solve</TT>
Symbols &gt; at the 8-th position marks suppressed observation. All 
suppressed observations will be re-fringed.<P>

  There is a way to change the list of observations that will be re-fringed.
If an analyst does not want to re-fringe some observations, the lines that
correspond to these observations should be either removed from the listing
file or the character at the 8th column of the rows that correspond to those
observations should be changed to <TT>K</TT>. Alternatively, if an analyst 
would like to re-fringe a given observation  even it it is not suppress, 
the character at 8th column should be changed to <TT>R</TT>. Re-fringing
an observation of a source that had a priori position errors exceeding
1 arcsec may improve the SNR.

VTD/Post-Solve supports so-called automatic suppression status. This
status depends on a number of factors including detection status
and other parameters. When <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> creates a GVF
database it sets this status for version 1. But the status does not
automatically propagate to version 2 and higher. Wrapper
<EM class="wrap">pu.py</EM> propagates the status from version 1
database to the higher version.
<P>
  Let us consider the following situation. A given observations had 
SNR 4.7 and therefore was treated as unconditionally suppressed.
VTD/post-Solve does not show such observation and does not allow to 
restore it. After re-fringing then SNR grew to 6.8, i.e. the observations
was detected. Task <EM class="task">mkdb</EM> created GVF database 
version 1. The suppression status is version dependent. The observation
is marked as good in version 1, but unconditionally suppressed in
version 2.
<P>
   Wrapper <EM class="wrap">pu.py</EM> will set status "suppressed,
but recovered" in version 2. Then a user can reset status to "good".

The input for the wrapper is the file with averaged calibrated visibilities

  The wrapper assumes the filename with averaged calibrated visibilities has
the following form <TT>SSSSSS/EEE_uvs/JJJJJJJJJJ_B_uva.fits</TT> where 
<TT>SSSSSS</TT> is the directory specified in the keyword
<EM class="com">SESS_CODE</EM> of <EM class="pima">PIMA</EM> control file.
The wrapper generates 5 output files: 
<TT>SSSSSS/EEE_uvs/JJJJJJJJJJ_B_map.fits</TT> &mdash; FITS image,
<TT>SSSSSS/EEE_uvs/JJJJJJJJJJ_B_uvs.fits</TT> &mdash; self-calibrated, scan averaged

used be the imaging process,
<TT>SSSSSS/EEE_uvs/JJJJJJJJJJ_B.par</TT> &mdash; command file created by the DIFMAP.
<P>

  The quality of automatic image may or may not be satisfactory. Automatic
image does not perform flagging. If the visibility data are either too high or
too low for some IFs due to errors in amplitude calibration, or a portion
of data has garbage visibilities at some station(s) because the antenna(s)
were not on source, the quality of automatic image will be disappointing at best,
or totally garbage at worst. Running <EM class="com">onof</EM> and 
<EM class="com">gaco</EM> tasks usually solve these problems and substantially
reduces the chances that the automatically generated images will have 
unsatisfactory quality.
