fits_to_cfd  

NAME: 
      fits_to_cfd  -- generate the table of the correlated flux density
                      of a source observed with VLBI using both 
                      calibrated visibility and image data.

SYNOPSIS
       fits_to_cfd [-help] [-mode code] [-o output_file] 
                   fits_vis_file fits_map_file

DESCRIPTION

      fits_to_cfd  -- reads the fits files with calibrated visibility and 
                      image data, computes 
                      a) integrated total correlated flux density
                      b) median correlated flux density at short baselines
                      c) median correlated flux density at long  baselines
                      d) rms of the map noise
                      e) number of used observations
                      f) number of used scans
		      Results are written in a two-row table.

OPTIONS

        -help               -- print this message and exit.
        -o     output_file  -- name of the output file. If omitted, the 
                               table is printed on the screen.
        -mode  code         -- code of the computation algorithm. Reserved
                               for future use.
