Field  1:8   A8    IVS station name
Field 11:17  F7.4  Apriori offset according to the project
                   or local measurements in meters
Field 22:28  F7.4  Aposteriori offset in meters
Field 33:38  F6.4  Formal uncertainty of the estimate from VLBI solution
                   in meters. This field is blank if antenna axis offset
                   was not adjusted for this station
