Program  READ_CRL  reads Solve correlation file in binary CRL_SPOOL format 
and writes it to the output file in ascii CRL_SPOOL format. Refer to
$HELP_DIR/correlations.txt for description of the formats. This program also 
serves as an example of manipulation with Solve binary correlation files.

Usage:  read_crl  <correlation_file_name> [<output_file>]

   where <correlation_file_name> is a correlation file name in binary format. 
Solve writes down correlations in file $WORK_DIR/CORLxx where xx are Solve 
user initials. Of course, keyword CORRELATIONS should be specified in batch
control file for this solution, otherwise $WORK_DIR/CORLxx will be empty

   If output_file is omitted of it is '-' then correlations are written in 
standard output device (screen).
