        1 $SETUP
        ========
 
 
    The $SETUP section determines the solution's general characteristics.
 
                1.1 SETUP.DEFAULTS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {DEFAULTS [YES or NO]}
 
 
   Specifies how strictly syntax of the control file should be checked.
 
   YES - defaults will be permitted. If some fields are omitted Solve will
         try to guess what it should do. This feature is provided for backward
         compatibility only.
 
   NO -  defaults are not permitted. All keywords should be specified,
         otherwise BATCH would detect an error condition and terminate. It is
         recommended to use this option!!
 
NB: 1) if the keyword DEFAULTS is omitted then DEFAULTS YES is assumed.
    2) Currently (2000.05.10) DEFAULTS keyword is deactivated and makes no
       effect.
 
                1.2 SETUP.SOLUTION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SOLUTION    [COMPLETE or FORWARD or BACK or GLOBAL_ONLY or INDEPENDENT or
                SUPPRESS{ION} or *SUBTRACT]
 
 
    The SOLUTION keyword specifies the solution's type.
 
    COMPLETE    - performs complete combined global solution. At least one
                  parameter is treated as global parameter and estimated over
                  all observations and at least one parameter is treated as a
                  local parameter and estimated for each session independently.
 
    FORWARD     - Performs only the first step of the global solution. CGM is
                  created but not inverted at the end of this run.
 
    GLOBAL_ONLY - Performs the first step of global solution, creates CGM,
                  inverts it, obtains global parameters adjustment, computes
                  some statistics and quits without computing adjustment to
                  local parameters.
 
    BACK        - Performs only the second step of the global solution.
                  Required the input CGM which hold intermediary results of
                  the forward step of the global solution. Solve first inverts
                  CGM, finds estimates of the global parameters and their
                  formal uncertainties, then consecutively finds the estimates
                  of the local parameters and their formal uncertainties.
                  Finally, statistics of the solution are computed.
 
    INDEPENDENT - Solve analyzes each session in the arc-list specified in the
                  section $ARCS independently. It means that all parameters
                  are estimated using the observations of one session only.
 
    SUPPRESSION - removes suppressed global parameters from a CGM
                  so that two programs not related to BATCH can use it.
                  Rarely used mode.
 
    *SUBTRACT:  - modifies CGM for taking out contributions of some sessions
                  from an existing CGM.
 
                1.3 SETUP.CGM
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   CGM         [NONE or input_name] {output_name}
 
 
   This keyword identifies the solution's input and output CGMs (if any).
 
     Field 1 - identifies the input CGM.
 
               NONE - no CGM used.
 
               input_name - full path to the input CGM.
 
     Field 2 - names the output CGM, if the solution produces one: COMPLETE
               or FORWARD or SUPPRESSION solution type. The output CGM is
               ignored if the solution is not producing the CGM. If the
               solution produces a CGM, but the name of the output CGM is
               not specified, then BATCH will name the CGM according to rules
               given below.
 
     output_name omitted - names the output CGM C#####.#####, where each
                           pair of numbers represents the year, month, day,
                           hour, minute and second of the solution, in that
                           order in UTC timescale.
 
     output_name specified - names the output CGM output_name. output_name
                             should not include a path, because BATCH
                             automatically decides where to place the CGM,
                             as described below. The user should make sure that
                             output_name does not duplicate an existing name.
                             If it does, BATCH will stop before processing the
                             first superfile.
 
     If the output CGM is specified without path name then BATCH puts output
     CGM in the following directories and catalogs:
 
     Test solution:      catalog:   TSTCAT on SCRATCH_DIR
                         directory: $SCRATCH_DIR/
 
     Regular solution:   catalog:   CGMCAT on CGM_CAT_DIR
                         directory: $CGM_DIR/
 
     (The ID keyword determines whether or not the solution is a test solution.)
 
     If the first symbol of the filename is / then the filename is interpreted
     as an absolute name.
 
                1.4 SETUP.MERGE_CGM
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {MERGE_CGM  [NONE or (input_file )... ]
      .
      .
      .                              }
 
 
     Combines several CGMs to a new one.
 
     Field 1 -
             NONE - not to do merging
 
             (input_file) - specifies the merged CGM files. Path should be
                            supplied. Solve doesn't make any guesses where
                            to find the CGM(s).
 
                1.5 SETUP.ARC_FILES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   ARC_FILES  {SAVE} [NONE or 0 or [dir_1 [0 or dir_2 [0 or dir_3]]]
 
 
   Determines whether the run produces/uses arc_files, and, if so, where to
store/search for them. Arc_file is a file with intermediary results produced
by Solve in the forward step and used in the backward step.
 
     Field 1 - Ordinarily back steps purge arc files as soon as they've used
               them. This field saves the files for future solutions.
 
     Field 2 - Determines whether BATCH produces/uses arc files, and, if so,
               where to store/search for them.
 
           0 - Prevents forward steps from producing arc_files. Tells back
               steps to create arc_file information. In this case back will
               repeat the work which forward step has done but did not store.
 
               Up to three paths can be specified. BATCH creates (forward step)
               or looks for (back step) arc files on these directories. BATCH
               creates/looks for session n in the $ARCS section as [####XX,
               where #### is n specified as four digits and XX is the run's
               initials. Leading zero(es) will be added if necessary in order
               to fit 4 digit format.
 
               NB: "n" (the number of the session in the arc-list) is computed
               according to the line number in the control file. If any line
               is removed or added then SOLVE cannot restore run correctly.
 
   In the forward step, BATCH starts with the first path and works its way
through the list as each path fills. Once BATCH goes to a new path, it does not
go back to see if space has been restored to previous paths, unless the user
restarts BATCH. Before creation of an arc_file BATCH checks disk space. It
considers the disk as full if it has less than 64 Mb free space. Once it runs
through the list, BATCH stops silently making arc files.
 
   Arc files take up a lot of space, so the users at an installation should
agree on the directories where the files should be created. Disk for arc_files
should be a fast disk. DON'T ASSIGN A REMOTE DISK as an arc-dir disk!
 
   If a back step cannot find an arc file, there is usually no problem, since
back steps can make the information on the fly, however, it would take
additional CPU time.
 
                1.6 SETUP.ID
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   ID          [60 characters]
 
 
   60 characters - a comment describing the solution. Setting the first four
characters to TEST turns the solution into a test solution.
 
   BATCH places the comment in the solution's progress file and CGM catalog
entry (if any). Some recommended pieces of information are the name of the
solution's control file, the purpose of the solution and the data being used.
 
   Setting ID to "TEST ...." redirects the output CGM to the test CGM
directory and catalog. The CGM keyword gives more details.
 
                1.7 SETUP.TRAIN
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {TRAIN [YES or NO GLO_PARLIM <number> INC_PARLIM <number>]}
 
 
   The keyword TRAIN specifies the mode in which Solve should run.
 
   TRAIN YES - forces Solve to call a chain (train) of executables for
               processing the job. It is not recommended to use this since
               Solve runs much slower than in NO TRAIN mode.
 
   TRAIN NO  - means that only one executable: BATCH will do entire work.
               It calls other modules as subroutines.
 
   NO TRAIN mode can be used for COMPLETE, FORWARD, BACK and INDEPENDENT
            types of solutions.
 
   Qualifier GLO_PARLIM specifies an expected number of global parameters. It
   should not exceed the maximal number of parameters specified by solve_reset
   and should not be less than parameter GLO_PARLIM__LIM specified in
   ../include/glbc4.i (current value: 256). BATCH grabs dynamic memory from
   the very beginning and it should know the maximal size of CGM. What will
   occur if the actual number of global parameters turns out greater than
   GLO_PARLIM? In the case BATCH will save CGM, free dynamic memory, increase
   the limit of expected parameters by INC_PARLIM (but not more than the
   maximal number of parameters for the set of scratch files, specified by
   solve_reset!), grab dynamic memory once more, restore CGM and continue
   computation. INC_PARLIM specifies the increment of the parameters limit.
 
   Example:
 
   If a user makes a global solution and expects the number of global
   parameters will be about 1280 then a good choice is
 
     TRAIN NO GLO_PARAM 1280 INC_PARLIM 128
 
   NB: If the actual number of parameters turns out exceeding the limit
specified by solve_reset in making scratch files then Solve will treat this
situation as a fatal error.
 
                1.8 SETUP.SORT
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SORT  {NO  or  {YES}  STATIONS [NO or ALPHABET or LONGITUDE]
                          SOURCES  [NO or ALPHABET or RIGHT_ASCENSION] } }
 
 
   BATCH in "NO TRAIN" mode is able to sort (or not to sort) global parameters.
Parameters follow in this order: a) stations: position, velocity, axis offset;
b) sources: right ascension, declination; c) other global parameters; d) user
global parameters. They are kept in memory and put in the listing in that order.
 
 
   Field 1 -
 
         NO - not to sort sources, stations
 
   Filed 2 -
 
         STATIONS - how to sort stations
 
                  NO - not to sort at all. Stations are kept in order of their
                       appearance during the run.
 
                  ALPHABET - to sort the names in the alphabet order.
 
                  LONGITUDE - to sort them in increasing their longitudes.
 
   Filed 3 -
 
         SOURCES - how to sort stations. Sources are kept in order of their
                   appearance during the run.
 
                  NO - not to sort at all. Sources are kept in order of their
                       appearance during the run.
 
                  ALPHABET - to sort the names in the alphabet order.
 
                  RIGHT_ASCENSION - to sort them in increasing their right
                                    ascensions.
 
   Stations and sources follow in the order of their appearance in processing
the database list if they are not sorted. Stations can be sorted in alphabetic
order of their names, in increasing longitudes or not sorted at all. Sources
can be sorted in alphabetic order of their names, in increasing their right
ascensions or not sorted at all. It is more convenient to read listing with
sorted stations and sources.
 
   Recommended sorting:
 
   SORT SOURCES ALPHABET STATIONS ALPHABET
 
NB: SORT is ignored in TRAIN mode or in INDEPENDENT solution.
 
                1.9 SETUP.USER_PROGRAM
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {USER_PROGRAM [NONE or NAME {USER_BUFFER $STRING$}] }
 
 
   Each time BATCH processes an session, it reads it into the run's obsfil and
other work files, then executes the programs that perform least squares
analysis on the arc. USER_PROGRAM specifies the name of the program which
runs after reading obsfil but before processing the first observation.
USER_PROGRAM is used for adding user calibration to obsfil. User program can
also write down a file with user constraints to be imposed on local parameters.
File with constraints should has a name $WORK_DIR/ULC{solve_initials} .
 
   Field 1 - the program.
 
         NONE - disables the USER_PROGRAM feature.
 
         NAME - the name of the program. May be up to 128 characters long
                and should not be enclosed in delimiters. If the first symbol
                of the name is "/" then it is interpreted as an absolute path.
                If not, then it is assumed that the executable with this name
                as in the $SOLVE_DIR directory. Specification of the full path
                name is recommended.
 
   Field 2 - a string passed to the user program
 
         STRING - specifies a string up to 80 characters long. The string
                  be enclosed by a delimiter (e.g., ") which is not blank
                  and not backslash character \ . This string is passed to
                  the user program without delimiters as argument of
                  CHARACTER*80 type. If the actual length of the STRING
                  is less than 80 than trailing blanks will added.
                  User program should read this string using pipe.
 
Comments:
 
  1) If the field 2 is supplied, then the user program **MUST ALWAYS**
     read 80 bytes from the pipe. For example it should have a statment like
 
          CALL USE_BUFFER ( %REF(STRING), INT2(40), 'ORC' )
 
     Failure to execute this statment in user program will result in
     overflowing the pipe. When the pipe is overflown, Solve "hangs":
     it waits indefinitely for reducing the size of message in the pipe.
 
  2) If the field 2 is not supplied then user program SHOULD NOT attempt
     to read from the pipe.
 
  3) Character "\" cannot be used as a delimeter in USER_BUFFER.
 
 
                1.10 SETUP.USER_PARTIALS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {USER_PARTIALS    [NONE or PROGRAM_NAME] }
 
 
   USER_PARTIALS allows user to add a list of his/her own parameters. BATCH
reads a superfile, writes it in obsfil and then call a program specified as
a value of the keyword USER_PARTIALS. That program has access to obsfil and
writes a list of user parameters and partial derivatives which correspond to
these parameters. User parameters are estimated in addition to the SOLVE
pre-defined parameters.
 
     Field 1 - user program name, which generates user partials. If the first
               symbol of the name is "/" then it is interpreted as absolute
               path. If not then it is assumed that the executable with this
               name is in the $SOLVE_DIR directory. Specification of the full
               path name is recommended.
 
 
                1.11 SETUP.USER_CONSTRAINTS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {USER_CONSTRAINTS     [NONE or PROGRAM_NAME] }
 
 
   USER_CONSTRAINTS allows user to apply his/her constraints imposed on global
parameters. The program specified as a value of the keyword USER_CONSTRAINTS
reads a superfile, writes it in obsfil and then call a program specified as
a value of the keyword USER_PARTILAS. That program has access to obsfil and
writes a list of equations of constraints and right parts in the file with
name CNSF{solve_initials}.
 
   NB: USER_CONSTRAINTS imposes constraints ONLY on global parameters. If the
user need to impose constrains on local parameters he/she should force
USER_PROGRAM to write down the file with name ULC{solve_initials} .
 
     Field 1 - user program name, which generates user partials. If the first
               symbol of the name is "/" then it is interpreted as absolute
               path. If not then it is assumed that the executable with this
               name is in the $SOLVE_DIR directory. Specification of the full
               path name is recommended.
 
                1.12 SETUP.WEIGHTS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {WEIGHTS  [NO or IN or (  [USE or REQUIRE or MAKE or APPEND]
                           [weight_file or (#NUM weight_file ...) ]
                           { [BY_SITE or BY_BASELINE or BY_ARC or DEFAULT] }
                           { ALGORITHM [MYWAY or UPWEI or UPWEI_OPT or
                             (ELIM paru_file)]     } ) ] }
 
 
   This keyword determines whether BATCH
a) should use corrections to weights from the external file, and if yes which
   type corrections: by baseline, by site, by session;
b) should generate the external files of corrections to weights.
 
   weighs of observable are computed as
 
   weight = 1/dsqrt ( sig_snr**2 + corr**2 )
 
   here sig_snr -- formal uncertainty computed on the basis of SNR,
        corr -- correction to weights. It may be baseline-dependent,
        site-dependent or session-dependent.
 
   If a keyword WEIGHTS is not specified then weights saved in superfile will
   be in use.
 
   NO - means no corrections to weights will applied, and the corrections to
        the weights kept in the superfiles will be discarded.
 
   IN - means that corrections to weights kept in the superfiles should be
        applied.
 
   MAKE and APPEND - generate corrections to weights for every session in the
        solution and place them in output weight_file. (MAKE creates the new
        file, and APPEND appends to an existing file.)
 
   USE  and REQUIRE - attempt to use weight_file for every session in
        the solution.  If weight_file does not contain a session, USE
        uses the weighting scheme recorded in the session's superfile, and
        REQUIRE aborts.
 
   #NUM -- the number of weight files in the range 1 to 4. If only one weight
           file is used, this parameter can be omitted.
 
   weight_file -- a full path to the file with additive re-weighting
                  parameters.
 
   BY_BASELINE together with MAKE and REQUIRE means that baseline-dependent
           correction to weights should be generated. Ignored if USE of
           REQUIRE qualifiers were specified, since the type of corrections to
           the weights is determined by file file format.
 
   BY_SITE together with MAKE and REQUIRE means that station-dependent
           correction to weights should be generated. Ignored if USE of
           REQUIRE qualifiers were specified.
 
   BY_ARC  together with MAKE and REQUIRE means that session-dependent
           correction to weights should be generated. Ignored if USE of
           REQUIRE qualifiers were specified.
 
   DEFAULT (or keyword omitted) - weights by baseline. It is strongly
            recommended not to use this qualifier!
 
   ALGORITHM - specifies the algorithm to be used for making corrections to
               weights. Ignored if USE of REQUIRE qualifiers were specified.
 
             MYWAY - John Gipson's algorithm for computing corrections to
                     weights for delays and delay rates will be used.
                     NB: MYWAY algorithm is not compatible with NO TRAIN mode!
 
             UPWEI - Leonid Petrov's algorithm for computing corrections to
                     weights for delays will be used.
 
             UPWEI_OPT - optimized version of Leonid Petrov's algorithm for
                         computing corrections to weights for delays will
                         be used.
 
             ELIM  - weights, outliers elimiation and resurrection of
                     previously suppressed observations is computed by
                     the ELIM algorithym developed by Leonid Petrov.
                     The name of the PARU control file should be specified
                     after the qualifier ELIM. Refer to ELIM documenatation
                     for syntax of the PARU control file.
 
   BATCH produces corrections to weights which match the data type selected for
the session through the $SESSIONS section or the $DATA sections TYPE keyword.
BATCH writes each session's weights to a separate line, along with the
session's key name and version. Weight files are in ASCII format. Weights file
has different formats for baseline-dependent corrections, site-dependent
corrections, session-dependent corrections.
 
    Only independent solutions can create or update weight files.
 
                1.13 SETUP.SOURCE_WEIGHTS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SOURCE_WEIGHTS [NO or ( [USE or REQUIRE] source_weight_file] ) }
 
 
   This keyword determines how to use source-dependent correction to weights.
 
   Field 1 -
 
         NO  - not to use source-dependent correction to weights.
 
         USE - if there is a source_weight_file and the source is found in
               the file, use its value from this file, otherwise, use from
               superfile.
 
         REQUIRE - all sources must be in source_weight_file, otherwise, there
                   will be an error.
 
   Field 2 - specifies the source weight file.
 
                1.14 SETUP.ELEVATION_DEPENDENT_NOISE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {ELEVATION_DEPENDENT_NOISE [NO or [YES el_dep_noise_file] or
                                     ([GLOBAL global_sigma]
                                      {[STATION_FILE file_name]}) or
                                      [MULTI_GLOB value]]}
 
 
   The keyword ELEVATION_DEPENDENT_NOISE allows user to make
correction to weights according to their elevation angles. The new
weight ata baseline {ij} is expressed throuth the old weight signa_in as
 
sigma_out_ij = sqrt ( sigma_in_ij**2 + (R_i*M(e_i))**2 + (R_j*M(e_i))**2 )
 
where R_k is the parameter from the table below for the k-th station,
e_k is the elevation at the k-th station, and M(e) is the mapping function.
Two formats are supported: pre-JAN2000 and POST-DEC2007.
The pre-JAN2000 format uses these qualifiers:
 
 
      Field 1 -
 
            YES - weights data.
 
      Field 2 -
 
            specifies the elevation dependent noise file in the
            pre-JAN2000 format.
 
   Documentation in the format of the elevation dependent noise
in the pre-JAN2000 format is lost. This format is not recommended
for use.
 
The post-JAN2000 format uses these qualifiers:
 
   Field 1 -
 
              GLOBAL
 
   Field 2 -
 
              global_sigma -- reciprocal weight for the zenith direction
                              in seconds that is applied to all stations.
 
   Field 3
 
              STATION_FILE
 
   Field 4
              file_name    -- the file name in eldep format that specifies
                              reciprocal weights for the zenith direction
                              in seconds for each listed station
                              individually. That reciprocal weight
                              overrides global_sigma. For those stations,
                              not listed in the this file, reciprocal
                              weight global_sigma is to be applied.
 
  Format specifications of the ELDEP format of 2007.12.03
 
 
The file in ELDEP format specifies reweighting parameters that
are elevation-dependent and station dependent
 
The used reciprocal weights at the baseline ij is computed as
 
sigma_out_ij = sqrt ( sigma_in**2 + (R_i*M(e_i))**2 + (R_j*M(e_i))**2 )
 
where R_k is the additive parameter from the table below for the
k-th station, e_k is the elevation at the k-th station, and M(e)
is the mapping function of elevation that is the ration of the
slanted path delay at elevation e to the path delay in the zenith
direction.
 
Format:
 
The file in ELDEP format consists of records in ASCII coding.
The first records identifies the format revision date
Records that starts from character # are considered as comments
Date records have the following format:
 
Field   1:8   A8
Field  11:24  D14.8  Additive reweighting parameter to delay in seconds
Field  27:40  D14.8  Additive reweighting parameter to delay rate in s/s
 
  An alternative way to specity the elevation dependent noise variance is
to use MULTI_GLOB keyword
 
  Keyword:
 
  MULTI_GLOB  {value}  -- sets the variance of the elevation depended
                          noise proportional to the slanted
                          un-hydrostactic path delay. The value specifies
                          the coefficent of this proportionality.
 
                1.15 SETUP.GPS_TEC_NOISE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {GPS_TEC_NOISE [NO or [YES gps_tec_noise_file] [NO_IONO_CONTRIB]}
 
 
   The keyword GPS_TEC_NOISE allows a user to make correction to weights
by incorporating an empirical model of residual errors of propgation
through the ionosphere after applying the GPS TEC model.
 
      Field 1 -
 
            NO  -- do not apply the empirical GPS TEC model
            YES -- apply an empirical GPS TEC model
 
      Field 2 -
 
            gps_tec_noise_file --  name of the file in gps_tec_noise
                                   format that describes the error
                                   model.
 
      Field 3 - NO_IONO_CONTRIB -- if present, then the ionosphere
                                   contribution specified in VTD
                                   will be used onbly for computation
                                   of additional noise and will not
                                   be applied to delay and rate
 
 
  The format of gps_tec_noise file:
 
The file in gps_tec_noise format consists of records in ASCII coding.
The first records identifies the format revision date
Records that starts from character # are considered as comments
Date records have the following format:

                1.16 SETUP.USER_TAG
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {USER_TAG  [user_inits] SOL_TAG   [solution_tag]}
 
 
   By specifying these two options, users' solution will be recorded into
solution archive catalog system. User_inits, two letters user initials,
case insensitive, must be registered in solution catalog, or, solution stops
with error. solution_tag must consist of a number from 1 to 9999, optionally
followed by up to 4 characters. USER_TAG and SOL_TAG must be taken as a pair
to present or be omitted.
 
   This option is only available on the 700 series HP computers. 4 files,
gl, ar, sp, pr, will be registered in solution catalog. gl: control file;
ar: session list; sp: spool file; pr: outline data. name expression:

                1.17 SETUP.SNR_MIN
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SNR_MIN [NO or [SNR_MIN_X SNR_MIN_S]]}
 
 
   The keyword SNR_MIN allows a user to set the minimum SNR at
two bands: upper and lower. Observations with SNR less than
these limits, will be suppreessed. NB: this feature works only
if the database is in the GVF format and suppression type is META.
 
      Field 1 -
 
            NO  -- do not suppress observations with low SNR.
 
      Field 2 -
 
            SNR_MIN_X -- Minumim SNR for the upper (X) band.
 
      Field 3 -
 
            SNR_MIN_X -- Minumim SNR for the lower (X) band.
 
                1.18 SETUP.FAST_MODE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {FAST_MODE [NONE or B3D or B1B3D]}
 
 
   BATCH Solve supports several algorithms of solving LSQ problem. The keyword
FAST_MODE sets the algorithm.
 
   NONE  - in INDEPENDENT mode means to use strait-forward algorithm;
           in COMPLETE, FORWARD, BACK solution types means to use B1D algorithm
           (arc parameters elimination).
 
   B3D   - in INDEPENDENT solution type means to use B3D algorithm
           (recommended way). B3D mode is not supported in COMPLETE, FORWARD
           and BACK solution types.
 
   B1B3D - in in COMPLETE, FORWARD, BACK solution types means to use B1B3D
           algorithm (recommended way). B1B3D is not supported in INDEPENDENT
           solution types.
 
   B3D and B1B3D algorithms are mathematically equivalent to the direct
strait-forward methods of solving LSQ problems but they are much faster.
In practice they give slightly different results since rounding errors are
accumulated by the different way. However, the difference in the estimates
usually are very small: less than 0.0001 sigma and does not exceed 0.1 sigma
even for the worst case of unstable parameterization.
 
   B3D and B1B3D together are called "fast mode" while NONE is called slow
mode. Solve runs faster by the factor 1.5-20 in fast mode.
 
 
                1.19 SETUP.FAST_DBG
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {FAST_DBG  [NONE or APPEARANCE  or PRINTOUT or TIMER or MONITOR]}
 
 
   Keyword FAST_DBG specifies debugging mode. Additional information is printed
on the screen and in temporary files if debugging mode is applied.
 
   NONE       - no debugging information will be printed (normal way).
 
   APPEARANCE - messages about starting and finishing computations from
                sole modules will appear on the screen.
 
   PRINTOUT   - verbose information about parameterization will be printed on
                the screen. Additional information including the list of
                parameter names will be printed in the file /tmp/param.fil
 
   TIMER      - information about elapsed and CPU time taken by different
                subroutines during processing each session is printed on the
                screen and in parallel is written in the file
                $WORK_DIR/TIMR{solve_initials} .
 
   MONITOR    - The line with current status of SOLVE is printed and it
                is updated every second. The format of the status line is
                the same as the format of the SMON status line.
 
                1.20 SETUP.FAST_COV
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {FAST_COV  [GLOBAL or LOCAL or SEGMENTED or FULL]}
 
 
    It is possible to restrict computation of covariance matrix when Solve runs
in fast mode. Solve runs faster when computation of covariance matrix is
restricted. Keyword FAST_COV doesn't make any effect in slow mode.
 
    GLOBAL    - only covariance of global parameters are computed. chi/ndg
                statistics is not available in this mode.
 
    LOCAL     - Covariance of global and local parameters (but not segmented)
                is computed. chi/ndg statistics is not available in this mode.
 
    SEGMENTED - Covariance of global, local and segmented parameters
                is computed, while only blocks of covariance matrices between
                parameters of the same and adjacent blocks are computed.
                chi/ndg statistics is available in this mode.
 
    FULL      - all elements of covariance matrix are computed. This mode
                is slow and is not recommended.
 
                1.21 SETUP.SAVING_RATE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SAVING_RATE  <rate>}
 
 
   Keyword SAVING_RATE specifies how frequently intermediary CGM should be
written in disk in forward step of global solution. BATCH writes intermediary
CGM after processing each <rate> sessions where <rate> is an integer value.
SAVING_RATE affects only forward step of global solution. Recovery of the
interrupted BATCH solution is possible only after saving the intermediary CGM.
For example if saving rate is 100 and solution was interrupted during
processing the 188-th session, a Solve run in recovery mode would start from
the 101-th session. Thus, the larger value <rate>, the more unnecessary work
will be done in recovery of the solution. The smaller value <rate>, the slower
Solve is running since writing intermediary CGM takes considerable time.
Recommended value is 128 for normal runs.
 
                1.22 SETUP.EMULATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {EMULATION [0 or 9612]}
 
 
   Solve internal logic of handling segmented parameters was slightly changed
since December 1996 what resulted in small differences between solutions
(which, however, don't exceed 1.0 sigma in the worst case). Solve is able
to emulate pre DEC-1996 logic.
 
      0 - normal way of computation (recommended)
   9612 - emulation of compatibility with old, pre-DEC96 logic. This mode
          is incompatible with fast modes. Do not use it unless you really
          understand what you are doing.
 
 
 
                1.23 SETUP.SUPMET
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SUPMET       [UND or PRE98 or PRE91 or COMB1 or SNGBA or META]}
 
 
   Keyword SUPMET specifies the suppression method used for determination
suppression status of each observation.
 
   UND   - undefined method. The suppression method saved in the database
           will be used.
 
   PRE98 - pre-1998 method
 
   PRE91 - pre-1991 method (not recommended). Supported for compatibility only.
 
   COMB1 - combination method
 
   SNGBA - single baseline method.
 
   META  - meta method.
 
   Refer to manual to ELIM for details.
 
 
                1.24 SETUP.QUALCODE_LIMIT
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {QUALCODE_LIMIT [1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9]}
 
 
  Keyword QUALCODE_LIMIT sets the maximum quality code of the observation which
is still considered as potentially recoverable. Value 5 is recommended.
 
 
                1.25 SETUP.SINGULARITY_CHECK
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SINGULARITY_CHECK [NONE or ACTION [NONE or WARINING or REPARAMETERIZE or
                                      SKIP or STOP]
                              SOUMIN [NO or <non-negative_integer>]
                              STAMIN [NO or <non-negative_integer>]
                              BASMIN [NO or <non-negative_integer>]]
 
 
   Keyword SINGULARITY_CHECK specifies whether to enable or disable singularity
check. If singularity check is enabled then criteria of singularity and
the action what to do in the case when singularity is detected are to be
specified. Singularity check is performed after building a normal matrix
but before its inversion.
 
   NONE -- singularity check is disabled.
 
   ACTION -- determines which action is to be done if the normal matrix will
             be pronounced singular:
 
             NONE -- nothing
 
          WARNING -- a warning message will be printed in the screen. Then
                     Solve will stoop in attempt to invert a singular matrix,
                     but a user will know the reason why the normal matrix
                     turned out singular.
 
          REPARAMETERIZE -- Solve will try to correct parameterization. Then it
                            starts to build the normal matrix anew. The type
                            of correction depends on the reason of singularity:
                            a) too few observations of the source which
                               coordinates are to be estimated -- all
                               observations of this source are deselected,
                               and coordinates of this sources are not
                               estimated.
 
                            b) too few observations at the station -- all
                               observations at this station are deselected,
                               and all parameters related to this station,
                               position, clock function, atmosphere path delay
                               etc are not estimated. The list of
                               baseline-dependent clock parameters is
                               re-computed.
 
                            c) too few observations at the baseline -- all
                               observations at this baseline are deselected,
                               the list of baseline-dependent clock parameters
                               is re-computed.
 
                            If the session was considered as singular on the
                            basis of more than one criteria then more than
                            one action is performed.

                                       good observations then the normal matrix
                                       is considered singular.

                                       good observations then the normal matrix
                                       is considered singular.

                1.26 SETUP.DECIMATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {DECIMATION [NO or
                      [CREATE  directory [ASCII or BINARY]] or
                      [REQUIRE directory param] or
                      [USE     directory param]
               ]
 
 
   Keyword DECIMATION specifies one of the actions
 
   CREATE  -- create a set of decimation files in the directory specified
              in the second value of the keyword. The file has name {exp}.edb
              or {exp}.eda where {exp} is the database name with leading
              $-character removed. The ascii decimation file has five header
              lines and NOBS observations record, where NOBS is the number of
              observations. An observation record has fields observation index,
              scan index, station names, source name, suppression status
              and decimation status. Solve writes in the observation the
              suppression status of each observation and an initial decimation
              status 0 for suppressed observations and 1 for used observations.
 
              The third value, ASCII or BINARY, specifies in which format
              the decimation file is to be created. Files in ascii format
              have extension .eda, files in binary format have extension
              .edb .
 
   REQUIRE -- requires to use decimation status recorded in decimation files.
              Solve searches for a file with name in the directory specified
              in the second value of the keyword with name {exp}.edc
              if does not exist, with name {exp}.eda, where {exp} is the
              database name with leading $-character removed. If it does not
              find decimation file, Solve writes the error message and
              stops. Solve examines the header of the file. If the header
              has different number of stations, sources, scans etc than the
              database, Solve writes the error message and stops. Solve
              examines each observation record. If the field decimation
              status is the same as the third argument param, Solve uses
              this observation, otherwise the observations is discarded.
              If param is zero or positive and the observations is
              suppressed, Solve does not use this observation. If param is
              negative, and decimation status is the same as param, Solve
              uses the observation regardless, whether it was previously
              suppressed or not.
 
   USE     -- the same as require, but if the decimation file does not
              exist or has wrong format, or wrong header, Solve prints
              a warning and ignores decimation.
 
   Solve supports two formats for external decimation files: binary and
   ascii. An external decimation file in binary format has extension .edb,
   and an external decimation file in binary format has extension .eda.
   Solve first searches for a binary file with extension .edb . It if
   does not find, it searchs for an ascii file with extension .eda .
   If there exist two files,with estension .edb and with extension .eda ,
   the file with extension .eda is ignored.
 
   Binary files should be used. Usage of ascii files involves siginificant
   overheads and desigined primarily for testing.

              be read from these files.
 
  UPDATE   -- to update path delay file. Teh path delay will be computed
              for the forward run of batch solution and will be used for

   {WARNING [NO or ON or OFF]}
 
 
   Keyword WARNING specifies whether or not to print warnings on the screen.
 
   NO  - not to print.
   OFF - not to print.
   ON  - print all warnings on stdout.

   Keyword DTEC_USE specifies the use of external files that have dTEC
   and delay bias between upper and lower band.
 
   APPLY  -- then FUSED data are created on the fly, DTEC, DTEC_ERR,
             DTEC_FLG, and DEL_BIAS_UL variables are iserted in oborg.
             If DTEC_FLG was zero, it is initialized. If DTEC_FLG  was
             not zero, it is not changed. If data type FUSED is
             specified, this data type is used for data analysis.
 
   IMPORT -- the same as APPLY, but the database is updated and
             variables DTEC, DTEC_ERR, DTEC_FLG, and DEL_BIAS_UL are
             written. The database version counter is not updated.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {name values}
 
 
  Keyword DEFINE defines envirnoment variable. Its definition will be
used inside Solve.
 
   name   -- name of the envirnoment variable in upper case
 
   values -- value of the envirotment variable. The value may have more
             than one word.
 
   Solve prints a message when it processes DEFINE keyword.
 
                1.32 SETUP.UNDEFINE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {name}
 
 
  Keyword UNDEFINE removes a definition of the envirnoment variable
specified as the keyword qualifier. If the envirnoment was not defined,
Solve does not consider that as an error and proceeds. The removal of
the definition is valid only within the Solve run and is discarded upon
Solve termination.
 
        2 $FLAGS
        ========
 
   This section specifies parameters to be estimated (adjusted). It must
precede the $CARRY and $SUPPRESSION sections. Rules specified in this section
are applied to all sessions from arc-list, unless special flags are specified
in the arc-list for special session which overrides rules in the $FLAGS section.
 
                2.1 FLAGS.SOURCES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SOURCES         [NO or YES or IN] {REF_EPOCH epoch} {src_comp}
                   [ref_source or PICK or
                    EXCEPT ([src_comp] source ...\) }
 
 
   The SOURCES keyword determines whether BATCH estimates source coordinates.
Fields 1-3 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all sources. Field 4
adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for the specific
sources. This includes either lifting the flag to estimate right ascension
for the reference source or specifying exception list. The estimation flag is
reversed for the specified components of the objects in the exception list.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - to estimates coordinates of all source.
 
           NO  - does not estimate any source's coordinates.
 
           IN  - keep estimation flags set in the database in interactive
                 solution and saved in the superfile.
 
     Field 2 - Epoch too which the estimates are to be referred. In the case
               if no proper motion is estimated this qualifier is ignored.
               If proper motion is estimated, then source coordinates are
               modeled as "prop_motopm*(t - t0) + coord". So, the field 2
               specified this epoch t0 in TDB scale. The value of the
               qualifier is in the format YYYY.DD.MM-hh:mm:ss . Only YYYY
               potion is mandatory. Other fields of the epoch, if omitted,
               are filled by xxxx.01.01-00:00:00 . Example of valid epochs:
               2000, 1997.01.01, 2002.12.27_08:40:49 . If the qualifier
               REF_EPOCH and its value are omitted then Solve sets default
               date 2000.01.01_12:00:00 . This default is for compatibility
               with early version of Solve only. It is recommended that the
               qualifier REF_EPOCH should **always** be specified in global
               solutions when source coordinates and proper motions are
               estimated.
 
     Field 3 - a global source component. Field 1 is applied only for the
               component specified in field 2. If omitted then RD
               (right ascension and declination) is assumed.
 
     Field 4 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified
               in the fields 1-2. If field 3 is omitted then the previous
               qualifiers are applied to "All sources".
 
           ref_source -- selects the reference source, the source whose
                         right ascension is not estimated. This flag for
                         estimation of source's declination is not changed.
                         If an session does not contain ref_source,
                         BATCH aborts.
 
           PICK - uses the first source in every session as the reference
                  source.
 
           EXCEPT  -- exception list. Each element if this list is the source
                      name which can be preceded by the sub-field source
                      components. If the sub-field source component is omitted
                      than "RD" is assumed. Estimation flag for the specified
                      coordinate component of the specified source is toggled:
                      if global definition defined YES (to estimate this
                      component for this source), then this flag is reversed
                      (NOT to estimate) and vice versus.
 
 
           src_comp -- one of "RD", "R-", "-D", "--" where
                       R  --  stands for right ascension,
                       D  --  stands for declination,
                       -  --  stands for an unwanted component.
 
  How does it work.
 
a) Initialization.
 
   If field 1 is IN then source estimation status saved in the
   database/superfile is kept. Otherwise estimation flag is set to the status
   "not to estimate any source coordinate".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If source component is omitted, estimation flag is set for both right
   ascension and declination. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
   If the reference source was specified explicitly or implicitly (PICK) then
   the right ascension estimation flag of this source is lifted.
 
   For each source found in exception list, for each specified component of
   such a source the estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
  Comment: if not all two components of source coordinates were estimated,
           the NO-NET rotation constraints cannot be applied to such a source.
 
   Example:
 
1)   SOURCES   YES  REF_EPOCH 1997.01.01 EXCEPT 3C345
 
       Estimate right ascensions and declination for all sources, except 3C345.
 
1)   SOURCES   YES  REF_EPOCH 1996.01.01 -D
 
       Estimate right declination for all sources.
 
3)   SOURCES   NO  EXCEPT 3C345
 
       Estimate right ascensions and declination of 3C345 only.
 
4)   SOURCES   NO  R- EXCEPT 3C345
 
       Estimate right ascensions and declination of 3C345 only.
 
 
5)   SOURCE NO REF_EPOCH 1994.07.01 RD EXCEPT R- NGC5141 2134+00 -D 3C345
 
       Estimation right ascension of NGC5141, right ascension and declination
       of 2134+00, declination of 3C345
 
6)   SOURCE YES  REF_EPOCH 2000.01.01_12:00:00
 
       Estimate coordinates of all sources.
 
 
                2.2 FLAGS.PROPER_MOTIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {PROPER_MOTIONS [NO or YES] {src_comp} {EXCEPT ([src_comp] source ...\) }
 
 
 
   The PROPER_MOTIONS keyword determines whether BATCH estimates sources
proper motions. Fields 1-2 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all
sources. Field 3 adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for
the specific sources. It defines exception list which consists of source name
and optionally source components. Estimation flag is reversed for the specified
components of the objects in the exception list.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - to estimates all proper motions
 
           NO  - does not estimate any source's proper motions.
 
 
     Field 2 - a global source component. Field 1 is applied only for the
               component specified in field 2. If omitted then RD
               (right ascension and declination) is assumed.
 
     Field 3 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified
               in the fields 1-2. If field 3 is omitted then the previous
               qualifiers are applied to "All sources".
 
 
           EXCEPT  -- exception list. Each element if this list is the source
                      name which can be preceded by the sub-field source
                      components. If the sub-field source component is omitted
                      than "RD" is assumed. Estimation flag for the specified
                      coordinate component of the specified source is toggled:
                      if global definition defined YES (to estimate this
                      component for this source), then this flag is reversed
                      (NOT to estimate) and vice versus.
 
 
           src_comp -- one of "RD", "R-", "-D", "--" where
                       R  --  stands for right ascension,
                       D  --  stands for declination,
                       -  --  stands for an unwanted component.
 
  How does it work.
 
a) Initialization.
 
   Estimation flag is set to the status "not to estimate proper motion for any
   source".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If source component is omitted, estimation flag is set for both right
   ascension and declination. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
   For each source found in exception list, for each specified component of
   such a source the estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
 
 
                2.3 FLAGS.STATIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   STATIONS    [NO or YES] {REF_EPOCH epoch} {sta_comp} {D}
               [ref_station or PICK or
               {EXCEPT ([sta_comp] station) ...\) ...}]
 
 
   The STATIONS keyword determines whether BATCH estimates station positions.
Fields 1-2 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all stations. Field 4
adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for the specific
stations. This includes either lifting the flag to estimate station position
for the reference station or specifying exception list. The estimation flag is
reversed for the specified components of the objects in the exception list.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - to estimates station positions.
 
           NO  - does not estimate any station positions.
 
     Field 2 - Epoch too which the estimates are to be referred. In the case
               if no velocity is estimated this qualifier is ignored.
               If velocity is estimated, then position is modeled as
               "vel*(t - t0) + pos". So, the field 2 specified this epoch
               t0 in TDB scale. The value of the qualifier is in the format
               YYYY.DD.MM-hh:mm:ss . Only YYYY potion is mandatory. Other
               fields of the epoch, if omitted, are filled by
               xxxx.01.01-00:00:00 . Example of valid epochs: 2000,
               1997.01.01, 2002.12.27_08:40:49 . If the qualifier REF_EPOCH
               and its value are omitted then Solve sets default date
               1980.10.17_00:00:00 (This is the date of the best experiment
               of Merit program). This default is for compatibility with
               early version of Solve only. It is recommended that the
               qualifier REF_EPOCH should **always** be specified in global
               solutions when station positions and velocities are estimated.
 
     Field 3 - a global station component. Field 1 is applied only for the
               component specified in field 2. If omitted then XYZ
               (three Cartesian components in the crust-fixed reference system)
               is assumed.
 
     Field 4 (D) - (rarely used -- most users omit this field)
 
         field omitted - the components described below are not estimated.
 
         D - estimates the diurnal radial station component by session at every
             station. This field was implemented because nutation mimics
             diurnal station motion, and this field can show how much the
             station vertical affects nutation. BATCH performs this estimate
             by fitting a sine to the station vertical.
 
 
     Field 5 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified
               in the fields 1-2. If field 3 is omitted then the previous
               qualifiers are applied to "All stations".
 
         PICK - BATCH chooses the reference station for each session. BATCH
                refers to a list of reference stations, using the first station
                that is in the session. If none are, BATCH uses the first
                station it finds in the session. The list is located in the
                file $SAVE_DIR/STATION_PICK
                Estimation flag for all components of the reference station
                is set to "NO".
 
         ref_station - BATCH tries to use this station for every session.
                       If any session does not have the station, BATCH aborts
                       at the end of that session. Estimation flag for all
                       components of the reference station is set to "NO".
 
 
         EXCEPT  -- exception list. Each element if this list is the station
                    name which can be preceded by the sub-field station
                    components. If the sub-field station component is omitted
                    than "XYZ" is assumed. Estimation flag for the specified
                    coordinate component of the specified station is toggled:
                    if global definition defined YES (to estimate this
                    component for this station),then this flag is reversed
                    (NOT to estimate) and vice versus.

                       -  --  stands for an unwanted component.
 
  How does it work.
 
a) Initialization.
 
   Estimation flag is set to the status "not to estimate any station position".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If the station component is omitted, estimation flag is set for all three
   components in XYZ system. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
   If the reference station was specified explicitly or implicitly (PICK) then
   the estimation flag for the reference station is lifted.
 
   For each station found in the exception list, for each specified component
   of such a station the estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
  Restriction: XYZ and UEN components should not be mixed. You cannot estimate
  XYZ components for one station and UEN component for another station.
 
 
   Example:
 
1)   STATIONS YES  REF_EPOCH 1997.01.01
 
       Estimate XYZ coordinates of all stations
 
2)   STATIONS YES REF_EPOCH 1996.07.01  UEN EXCEPT U-- GIFU3  U-- CRIMEA
 
       Estimate Up, East North components for all stations, but to estimate
       only horizontal coordinates for stations GIFU3 and CRIMEA
 
  Comment: if not all three components of station position were estimated,
           the NO-NET trasnaltion and rotation constraints cannot be applied
           to such a station.
 
   NB: The STATIONS keyword must always precede the VELOCITIES keyword.

   VELOCITIES  [YES or NO] {sta_comp}

   The VELOCITIES keyword determines whether BATCH estimates station velocities.
Fields 1-2 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all stations. Field 3
adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for the specific
stations. It defines exception list which consists of station name
and optionally station components. Estimation flag is reversed for the

               is assumed.
 
     Field 3 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified

  How does it work.
 
a) Initialization.
 
   Estimation flag is set to the status "not to estimate any station velocity".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If the station component is omitted, estimation flag is set for all three
   components in XYZ system. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
 
   For each station found in the exception list, for each specified component
   of such a station the velocity estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
 
Examples:
 
 
  1) VELOCITIES YES EXCEPT XY- GILCREEK HRAS_085
 
       BATCH estimates X, Y and Z velocities at all stations except GILCREEK
       and HRAS 085, where only X and Y are estimated.
 
  2) VELOCITIES NO UEN EXCEPT -EN GILCREEK
 
       Only the East and North velocities at GILCREEK are estimated.
 
  3) VELOCITIES YES X-- EXCEPT -YZ WESTFORD HRAS_085 XYZ GILCREEK
 
       At GILCREEK and HRAS 085, estimates Y and Z. No velocity component is
       estimated at Westfor. Everywhere else, estimates X component

  The HARMONIC_POS keywords specifies the harmonics (name, phase,
frequency), the list of station(s) for which harmonic variations
of coordinates are adjusted and the reciprocal weights of
no-net-rotation and no-net-translation constraints. More than one
harmonic can be specified. Each harmonic may have its own station list.
Contents of this keyword or any part of it may be specified in the
external file. Solve will read the file name specified with the prefix
@ and add its content to the batch control file for parsing. Six
parameters are adjusted for each harmonic and for each station from
the station list: the amplitude of sin ( phase + freq*t ) for X, Y,
and Z components, and the amplitude of cos ( phase + freq*t )
for X, Y, and Z components.
 
  In general, if harmonic variations were estimated for all sites, the
LSQ problem has rank deficiency 6*N_HAR, where N_HAR is the number of
harmonics. In order to overcome the rank deficiency, no-net-translation
and no-net-rotation constraints are to be imposed.
 
  Care should be taken in designing the list of stations for harmonic
site position variations estimation. A station with poor observation
history may not have enough observations for reliable estimation of
harmonic site position amplitudes and for its separation from global
site position, global velocity, and possibly coefficients of B-spline
estimates. For example, if a station observed only during several
occupations it is unlikely that its harmonic position variations at
annual frequency can be adjusted. A poor history of observations of
even one site may cause a failure of the global matrix inversion.
 
            NAME -- Unique name of the harmonic with 1-8 characters.
 
         STATION -- List of stations which participated in estimation of
                    position variations for this harmonic. Blanks insides

                    underscore. Alternatively, the list of stations or
                    its portion can be specified in a file. Character

                    Units: meters. Recommended value: 1.D-4

  Keyword  SPLINE_POS  determines the parameterization for estimation
of coefficients of expansion with the B-spline basis of positions
displacements of one or more sites. For each station the degree of
the basis, the time epoch of modes, the multiplicity of each nodes and
the reciprocal weights of constraints are specified. Either entire
specification of the keyword or any portion of specifications can be
put in an external file and the name of this file can be used as an
option with preceding @ character. Solve will read this @-file, and
puts its contents to the batch file (without modifying original batch
file) and parse its contents.
 
  NB: The multiplicity of the first and node should be equal to
spline degree. The multiplicity of the last node should be zero.
 
  If global site position is estimated, the global normal matrix has
rank deficiency 3. In order to reduce rank deficiency, de-mean
constraint can be imposed which requires the integral of the B-spline
over the interval from the first to the last node be equal to zero.
 
  If global site velocity is estimated, the global normal matrix has
rank deficiency 3. In order to reduce rank deficiency, de-trend
constraint can be imposed which requires the first moment of the B-spline
over the interval from the first to the last node be equal to zero.
 
  Care should be taken in designing the list of stations for non-linear
site position variations estimation. A station with poor observation
history may not have enough observation for reliable estimation of
harmonic site positions and for its separation from global site position,
global velocity and coefficients of B-spline estimates. A poor history
of observations of even one site may cause a failure of the global matrix
inversion.

   The CLOCKS keyword determines how the clock parameters are estimated.
Two formats are supported: the current and the obsolete marked by *. The
obsolete format is maintained only for providing backward compatibility and it
is not recommended to use it.
 
   Clocks in general are modeled by a sum of a local polynomial of the 1-st
or 2-nd degree plus linear spline with intervals of equal spans (linear spline
can be omitted). The local polynomial is estimated using all observations at
this station in the session. If the session has N clock breaks then N local
polynomials are estimated. Clock polynomials has discontinuities at the epochs
of clock breaks.
 
Current format:
---------------
 
     MAX_DEGREE - specifies the order of the local polynomial of clock function.
 
           IN   - take the same order as it saved in the database.
           AUTO - set order of the polynomial regardless the value saved in the
                  superfile.
           MOST - set order of the polynomial which is maximal between the
                  specified one conserved in the database.
                  1 -- polynomial of the first order will be used.
                  2 -- polynomial of the second order will be used.
 
     INTERVALS  - specifies length of span of linear spline.
 
        IN - the length of linear spline is taken from superfile.
 
        NO - no linear spline is estimated
 
     FORCE - uses a linear spline parameterization for every station in every
             session, with the requested interval in minutes. Totally
             overrides the parameterization in the sessions' superfiles,
             INCLUDING CLOCK BREAKS. Provided for backward compatibility only.
             Not recommended to use.
 
     AUTO - uses a linear spline parameterization for every station in every
            session, with the requested interval in minutes. Ignores the
            parameterization in the superfiles, except for preserving all
            clock breaks.
 
     MOST - for each session, performs a linear spline parameterization with
            the given interval at each station, unless the session's superfile
            contains a linear piecewise-continuous parameterization with
            a shorter interval. Then BATCH uses that interval. Preserves
            clock breaks. The interval must be in minutes.
 
Obsolete format:   (provided for backward compatibility only)
---------------
 
     DEFAULT - for each session, uses the parameterization recorded in

               for every station in every session, with the requested interval
               in minutes. Totally overrides the parameterization in the
               sessions' superfiles, including clock breaks.
 
     PICK    - uses a linear piecewise-continuous parameterization for
               every station in every session, with the requested interval in
               minutes. Ignores the parameterization in the superfiles, except
               for preserving clock breaks inserted with Solve's interactive
               automatic constraint feature.
 
     MOST    - for each session, performs a linear piecewise-continuous
               parameterization with the given interval at each station,
               unless the session's superfile contains a linear
               piecewise-continuous parameterization with a shorter interval.
               Then BATCH uses that interval. Preserves clock breaks inserted
               with Solve's automatic constraint feature. The interval must be
               in minutes.

   The UT1/PM keyword determines how BATCH estimates UT1 and polar motion
(X- and Y-wobble). UT1 and polar motion are collectively called earth
orientation. UT1/PM has two syntax format: the current ad the obsolete. The
obsolete format is provided only or backward compatibility and it is not
recommended to use. Long lines can be divided on shorter pieces. Symbol \ at
the end of the line is used as a continuation sign.
 
Current format:

    3) UT1/PM NO means not to estimate UT1 at all.
 
 
Obsolete format:
----------------
 
     Field 1 (the first five lines) -  determines how BATCH
     estimates UT1 and polar motion.
 
          NO - does not estimate UT1 or polar motion.
 
          YES - estimates one offset apiece for X-wobble, Y-wobble
                and UT1. BATCH estimates each offset at the first 0000 UTC
                epoch in the session.
 
          Other parameterizations - must be set as follows:
 
               The user must specify separate choices for polar
               motion (WOBBLE) and UT1. There are three categories
               of choices:
 
               1. No parameterization:
 
                    Specified by OFFSET ---.  (Both WOBBLE and UT1
                    use this syntax.)
 
               2. Parameterization style "0" (the traditional
               style, which estimates 0000 UTC offsets and rates):
 
 
                    Offsets - specified by OFFSET  XY- (for WOBBLE)
                    or OFFSET --U (for UT1).  The user can turn off
                    X- or Y-wobble by substituting a dash for that
                    parameter.
 
                    Rates - specified by RATE  XY- or RATE  --U.
                    (Again, the user can turn off X- or Y-wobble.)
                    Rates cannot be estimated unless offsets are
                    estimated.
 
               3. Parameterization style "1" (the new style, which
               estimates linear-piecewise continuous rates, etc.):
 
                    This style always automatically estimates an
                    offset and an unconstrained global rate at the
                    beginning of the experiment.  The user may
                    select up to three additional
                    parameterizations, using eop_type.  eop_type
                    must be DSR, where each letter turns on one of
                    the following choices and a dash in its place
                    turns it off:
 
                         D - estimates a diurnal sine.
 
                         S - estimates a semi-diurnal sine.
 
                         R - estimates constrained linear
                         piecewise-continuous rates.  The user must
                         also specify two real numbers, the
                         interval of the parameterization and the
                         constraint upon the rates, in that order.
                         These values have no default.  The
                         interval must be specified in hours, but
                         BATCH converts it to days.  The constraint
                         must be specified in mas/day for WOBBLE
                         and ms/day for UT1.  Readers should note
                         the difference between these constraints
                         and the ones for earth orientation in the
                         $CONSTRAINTS section.  The constraints in
                         the $CONSTRAINTS section apply to earth
                         orientation offsets, while the constraints
                         in this section apply to a specific type
                         of earth orientation rate.
 
                    The syntax for style "1" applies to both WOBBLE
                    and UT1.  This style parameterizes X- and Y-
                    wobble the same way.
 
     Field 2 - produces a file containing hourly UT1 and polar
     motion estimates and sigmas.
 
          OFF (or field omitted) - no file is produced.
 
          RESET - writes the values to WORK_DIR/EOPLxx, where xx are the Solve
                  user initials. Overwrites the previous contents of EOPLxx.
 
          APPEND - appends the values to EOPLxx.
 
     Each line of the file contains a five field time tag, then an estimate and
     sigma for X-wobble, then the Y-wobble values, then the UT1 values.
 
     Field 3 - calculates UT1/PM at the middle of experiment time.
 
 
                2.10 FLAGS.NUTATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   NUTATION        [NO or OFFSET or XY_OFFSET ]
 
 
   The NUTATION keyword determines how BATCH estimates the nutation parameters.
 
   NO - does not estimate nutation offsets.
 
   OFFSET    -- estimate daily offsets of nutation in longitude and
                nutation in obliquity using formalism of Newcomb-Andoyer.
                This forces Solve to put in listing in Sinex format
                estimates of nutation angles in longitude and in obliquity.
 
   XY_OFFSET -- estimate daily offsets of nutation in X and
                nutation in Y using formalism of Ginot-Capitaine.
                This forces Solve to put in listing in Sinex format
                estimates of nutation angles in X and Y.
 
   NB: Solve puts estimates of nutation angles both for nutation in
       longitude, nutation in obliquity, and nutation in X, nutation in
       Y direction in listing in Spool format. Therefore, this keyword does
       not change listing in Spool format, but changes listing in Sinex
       format.
 
 
                2.11 FLAGS.PRECESSION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   PRECESSION      [NO or YES]
 
 
   This keyword determines whether to estimate the precession constant.
 
   NO - does not estimate the precession constant
 
   YES - estimate the precession constant

  Keyword  HEO  determines the parameterization for estimation of
harmonic variations in Earth orientation. The instantaneous small Euler
angles of the perturbations in the Earth rotation with respect to
an apriori model are modeled as a sum of constituents of this form:

         <interval_in_hours> - time span between nodes of linear spline. Units
                               are hours. If the interval is longer than
                               duration of the session then the interval is

estimates.
 
   Field 1 -
 
           NO - does not estimate any offsets.
 
           YES - estimates every station's offset once for the entire solution.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   BASELINE_CLOCKS [NO or YES or IN]
 
 
   the keyword BASELINE_CLOCKS determines whether to estimate baseline
dependent clocks.
 
   NO  - not to estimate
 
   YES - estimate. The list of baseline-dependent clock is built by such
         a manner in order to estimate the maximal number of parameters which
         still guarantee the lack of singularity of the normal matrix.
 
   IN  - estimate baselines dependent-clocks for those baselines which were
         selected in superfile. Exceptions: a) if at least one baseline was
         deselected on the fly and the number of used baseline in the solution
         will be less than the number of baselines saved in the superfile;
         b) if the number of baselines were changed as a result of
         reparameterization when the session failed singularity test. In these
         cases the list of baseline-dependent clock parameters is computed anew
         in order to estimate the maximal number of parameters which still
         guarantees the lack of singularity of the normal matrix.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   IONOSPHERE_SCALE [NO or SES or STA or BAS]
 
 
   the keyword IONOSPHERE_SCALE determines whether to estimate ionosphere
path delay scale adjustment. Ionosphere scale is a factor of the difference
between of group delays at upper and lower bands for dual-band observations.
IONOSPHERE_SCALE is always local parameter. It is ignored for single-band
data types.
 
   NO  - not to estimate
 
   SES - estimate for each session.
 
   STA - estimate for each session and each station.
 
   BAS - estimate for each session and each baseline

                             {EXCEPT source1 source2 ...})
                        ]
 
 
   the keyword STRUCTURE_ADMITTANCE determines whether to estimate admittance
of source structure to group delay.
 
   NO  - not to estimate
 
   GLOBL - to estimate the admittance as global parameter.
 
   LOCAL - to estimate the admittance as local parameter.
 
   YES   - to estimate admittance for each selected source separately
 
   ALL   - to estimate admittance for all sources combined
 
   EXCEPT  - exception list.
             Construction "NO EXCEPT list" means that the source structure
             admittance should be estimated for each selected source from
             this list separately.
             Construction "YES EXCEPT list" means that the source structure
             admittance should be estimated for each selected source,
             which does not belong to this list, separately.
 
        3 $OUTPUT
        =========
 
    This section determines what output BATCH produces.
 
                3.1 OUTPUT.RESET
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   RESET        [YES or NO]
 
 
   This keyword determines whether the new output should be appended to the
old spool file or the spool file would be overwritten.
 
   YES - overwrites the spool file.
 
   NO -  appends the new output to the spool file.
 
                3.2 OUTPUT.FORWARD
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   FORWARD      [YES or NO or LAST or number_of_sessions]
 
 
   This keyword determines the points in a forward step of global solution
at which BATCH makes estimates of global and local parameters, based on the
sessions processed so far. This option is designated for the special purposes
and it not recommended for usual runs.
 
   NO - no estimation. (recommended)
 
   YES - does the estimation after every session. This is not recommended,
         because it will take a LONG time.
 
   number_of_sessions - does the estimation whenever BATCH has finished
                        the number of sessions specified. (For example, FORWARD
                        5 does the estimation every fifth session.)
 
   LAST - does the estimation after the last session. This option is useful
          in a forward solution, but pointless in a complete solution, since
          the solution's back step does the estimation itself.
 
                3.3 OUTPUT.BASELINES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   BASELINES    [YES or NO]
 
 
   YES - adds up to three types of output to the run's spool file, as described
         below, depending on how the station positions and velocities are
         estimated.
 
   NO - suppresses all three types of output described below.
 
   For a given session, BATCH produces baseline components for any baselines
with a station whose position components are session parameters. Specifically,
BATCH produces the baseline's length, transverse and vertical components,
the magnitude of the baseline vector, and these values' sigmas. BATCH produces
this output as part of the session's session parameter output.
 
   Assuming BATCH estimates at least one station's position components as
global parameters, BATCH produces the above information for every pair of
stations in the solution, even if some of the resulting baselines have no
observations.  BATCH produces this output as part of the global parameter
output.
 
   Assuming BATCH estimates velocities in addition to global position
components at one or more stations, BATCH also produces rate of change
information for every pair of stations in the solution. Specifically BATCH
produces the rate of change of each baseline's length, transverse and vertical
components, the rate of change of each vector's magnitude, and these values'
sigmas. BATCH produces this output as part of the global parameter output.
 
                3.4 OUTPUT.MINIMUM
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   MINIMUM      [YES or NO]
 
 
   The MINIMUM keyword suppresses part of the spool file output, to save space.
 
   YES - suppresses the following output.
 
    NO - produces the following output.
 
         -  the correlations that BATCH produces between a station's X, Y and
            Z position and velocity components, when the position components
            are global parameters. The correlations are part of the global
            output.
 
         -  part of the station table output that BATCH produces as part of
            the spool file's global output, if the user has set the
            STATION_TABLE keyword.  The discussion for this keyword describes
            this output in more detail.
 
         -  the following parts of BATCH's session parameter output:
 
            -  the list of the calibrations added to an session's theoreticals.
 
            -  the baseline and source statistics from an session's solution.
 
            -  the correlations between an session's UT1/PM and nutation
               parameters that BATCH produces for certain UT1/PM
               parameterization styles.
 
 
                3.5 OUTPUT.SCREEN
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *SCREEN      [YES or NO]
 
 
   The SCREEN keyword determines whether the information sent to this run's
spool file is also sent to the run's terminal (screen). Since the size of spool
file may be as large as one million lines it is not recommended to use this
option.
 
   YES - to send this information
 
   NO  - not to send this information (recommended).
 
                3.6 OUTPUT.COVARIANCES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *COVARIANCES [NO or
                       (YES [ALL or BY_SESSION or CGM or (dbname ver)]
                            [STA or NUT or EOP or ALL or SOU])]
 
 
   The COVARIANCES keyword determines what covariance output BATCH produces.
This option is obsolete and provided only for backward compatibility. There is
a restriction on the number of sessions and number of parameters which can
be supported by this option. These restrictions are installation specific.
It is recommended to use a keyword CORRELATIONS instead of.
 
   NO  - no covariance output.
 
   YES - produces output as follows:
 
         Field 1 - determines the extent to which BATCH produces the type
                   of covariance selected in field 2.  For example, if field 2
                   selects an session parameter, field 1 determines whether
                   BATCH produces the parameter's covariances for a single
                   session or for every session in the solution. Fields 1
                   and 2 must make sense when combined.  For example, if the
                   user chooses CGM for field 1, to produce global covariances,
                   then he/she must choose global parameters in field 2.
                   The $CARRY section identifies session and global parameters.
 
     ALL - produces the covariance matrix for the entire solution. Depending on
           field 2, this potentially includes covariances between global
           parameters, covariances between session parameters in a given
           session, and covariances between pairs of session and global
           parameters. ALL potentially generates a large amount of output,
           so users should select it carefully.
 
     CGM - produces a matrix for the covariances between the global parameters.
 
     BY_SESSION - produces the covariances between the session parameters in
                  a given session for every session in the solution.
                  Produces each session's covariances in a separate matrix.
 
     dbname ver - produces a matrix for the covariances between the session
                  parameters in the given session.
 
     Field 2 - the type(s) of covariances BATCH produces.
 
             STA - produces station position covariances.
 
             SOU - produces source coordinate covariances.
 
             EOP - produces covariances for the earth orientation parameters
                   selected in the $FLAGS section's UT1/PM keyword.
 
             NUT - produces covariances for the nutation parameters selected
                   in the $FLAGS NUTATION keyword.
 
             ALL - produces all of the above types.
 
     If the user selects ALL ALL, which generates covariances between different
sessions' parameters, he/she must make sure that the solution has an session
file for every session.
 
     BATCH writes the covariance output to the covariance file, $WORK_DIR/CVRFxx
file where xx are the solve user initials.

                            files are computed except the parameters listed
                            in PARAM_EXCLUDE files. See documentation about
                            correlations for specifications of the format

                            If the path is omitted then this file is sought
                            in $SAVE_DIR .
 
           PARAM_EXCLUDE  - specifies the file name of the correlations
                            definition file. Correlations between any parameter
                            and the parameters listed in the PARAM_EXCLUDE
                            are not computed.
 
           <par_filename> - see above
 
   GLO_LOC - correlations between global and local parameters should be
             computed. Local parameters are parameters which are estimated
             for each session independently and which are not segmented
             parameters. Example: nutation angle Delta Psi.
 
             The meaning of PARAM_INCLUDE, PARAM_EXCLUDE, <par_filename> is
             the same as for GLO_GLO qualifier.
 
   LOC_LOC - correlations between local parameters within the same session
             are to be computed.
 
             The meaning of PARAM_INCLUDE, PARAM_EXCLUDE, <par_filename> is
             the same as for GLO_GLO qualifier.
 
   CROSS_LOC - correlations between local parameters of different sessions
               are to be computed.
 
               The meaning of PARAM_INCLUDE, PARAM_EXCLUDE, <par_filename> is
               the same as for GLO_GLO qualifier.
 
               SES_INCLUDE - specifies the filename with the list of the
                             sessions. Correlations between local parameters
                             between these sessions are computed except the
                             sessions in the SES_EXCLUDE list.
 
               <ses_filename> - File name with the session list. If the path
                                is omitted the file is sought in $SAVE_DIR/
 
               SES_EXCLUDE - specifies the filename with the list of the
                             sessions. Correlations between local parameters
                             for the sessions from this list will not be
                             computed.

                3.8 OUTPUT.STATION_TABLE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {STATION_TABLE [NO or YES ]}
 
 
   The STATION_TABLE keyword produces a table of projected X, Y and Z position
components, at noon on January 1, for 1979 through 1992, for each globally
estimated station.
 
   NO - not to produce the station table output (recommended).
 
   YES - produce the station table output. The form of the tables depends on
         the MINIMUM keyword:
 
   If MINIMUM = YES - each station's table has one line per year
                      containing the projected X, Y and Z position totals and
                      unscaled sigmas.
 
   If MINIMUM = NO  - each station's table has four lines per year.
                      Line 1 contains the projected correlations between the
                      station's position components and between each component's
                      position and velocity. Lines 2-4 contain the components'
                      projected position totals, estimates and unscaled and
                      scaled sigmas.
 
   BATCH uses velocities and a reference date to project the positions. BATCH
projects positions for 1979 through 1992, regardless of the solution's data
span.
 
   BATCH only produces tables for the XYZ coordinate system.
 
                3.9 OUTPUT.POS_ELLIPSES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {MOD_FILES     [YES or NO]}
 
 
    This keywords specifies whether or not to attach MOD_FILES to the end of
spool files.
 
    YES  -- to attach copies all a priori mod files to the end of spool file.
 
    NO - not to attach these copies.
 
 
                3.11 OUTPUT.RESIDUALS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This keyword specifies whether to write residuals.
 
   NONE  -- not to write residuals (recommended).
 
   SPOOL -- to write residuals in ascii format into the spool file.
 
   FULL  -- the same as SPOOL: to write residuals in ascii format into
            the spool file.
 
   file_name -- the name of the output residual file ina a binary format.
                The file will be put in the directory where BATCH started,
                unless the full path name has been specified.
 
 
                3.12 OUTPUT.MINIMIZE_SIGMAS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {MINIMIZE_SIGMAS     [YES or NO]}
 
 
   When station positions and velocities are estimated then adjustments of
positions and the estimates of their uncertainties are referred to the
specified epoch. However, some stations participated only in a subset of
sessions. If the mean weighted epoch of the station observations substantially
differs from the reference epoch then the uncertainties of the station
positions increases. There exists an epoch such as the formal uncertainty of
the station position referred to that epoch is minimal. BATCH is able to
compute such an epoch for each station and compute the formal uncertainty for
the station positions referred to this epoch called "minimal sigmas".
 
   NO  - not to compute minimal sigmas.
 
   YES - compute minimal sigmas for each station whose positions and velocity
         are estimated as global parameters.

   Determines to generate a listing in SINEX format with results of the
parameters estimation related to the session. Currently, (2002.05.23) this
keyword is supported only for INDEPENDENT solution types and will be ignored
in global modes.

                      The format 2.10 is an extension of the format 2.00
                      The format 2.20 differs from format 2.10 that it uses
                      alternative parameter names suggested by Markus
                      Rotather in 2008. As of July 2008, no exsiting Sinex
                      parser will accept Sinex files in 2.20 format.

                      if the output file with the listing already exists.
                      If ALLOW_OVERWRITE YES, then Solve proceeds.
                      If ALLOW_OVERWRITE NO,  then Solve issues an error
                      message and stops.

   This keywords allows to print in the spool file a priori atmosphere zenith
path delay for each epoch of linear spline. This kind of the output is used
for the specific purposes and is not recommended for usual runs.
 
   NO - not to add a priori zenith path delay in spool file (recommended).
 
   YES - to print in the spool file a priori zenith path delay for each epoch
         of linear spline. If SEG_OUTPUT is YES then a priori zenith path is
         printed just before each line with adjustments of segmented
         parameters.

   The format of listing was slightly changed in April 1998 and in August 2003.
Keyword CRES_EMULATION allows us to get the listing in the old format. You
should understand that using option makes your lising incompatible with
software developed or modified after April 1998. For example, program getpar
will not be able to parse such a listing.
 
   Field 1 -
 
           NO   - the current format of the listing will be generated
                  (recommended)
         199804 - old pre-APR98 format of the listing will be generated
                  (NOT recommended)
         200308 - old pre-AUG03 format of the listing will be generated

  This keyword puts pSolve in a special mode for computation of the
parameters of the ionospheric model used for processing single band
observations. No least square solution is made. This computation is
done in three steps: 1) extract information about VLBI ionospheric
path delay and GNSS TEC model; 2) adjust dTEC bias (for dual-band
observations only); and 3) compute uncertainty of the ionospheric
path delay from the GNSS TEC maps using a regression model.

        4 $CARRY
        ========
 
 
   Some parameters can be treated either as global or as session parameters.
This section tells to BATCH how to treat these parameters. The user must
specify  a choice for these parameters. The $CARRY section must be preceded by
the $FLAGS section.
 
   The following table lists the current parameters and how BATCH treats them:
 
     Type              Parameters
 
     global or local   station positions, source coordinates
 
     always local      atmospheres, clocks, UT1/PM, parameters, nutation offset
 
     always global     station velocities, source proper motions, precession
                       and relativity parameters, antenna axis offsets.
 
     * Although the AXIS keywords appear to let the user make the axis offset
     session parameters, this keywords was created for a different purpose.
 
                4.1 CARRY.STATIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   STATIONS     [YES or NO] {sta_comp} {EXCEPT (station ...\)}
 
 
   The STATIONS keyword in the CARRY section determines how BATCH treats the
station positions selected in the $FLAGS section.
 
   Fields 1 and 3 - used together to make a basic choice. Field 2 can then be
used, as described below, to partially override this choice.
 
   Field 1 -
 
           YES - treats every station position as a global parameter.
 
           NO -  treats every station position as a local parameter.
 
   Field 3 (the EXCEPT phrase) - treats the listed stations' positions as
                                 local parameters, if field 1 is YES, and
                                 as global parameters, if field 1 is NO.
 
   Field 2 (sta_comp) -
 
         sta_comp omitted - BATCH treats the station positions as described
                            above.
 
         sta_comp - partially overrides the basic choices made in fields 1
                    and 3.  sta_comp must be XYZ or UEN, with '-'s (dashes)
                    indicating components to be treated as session parameters
                    at every station, including stations listed in the EXCEPT
                    clause. BATCH ignores components not replaced by dashes,
                    except to make sure that they match the coordinate system
                    specified in the STATIONS keyword in the $FLAGS section.
                    So components not replaced by dashes will be treated as
                    specified in fields 1 and 3.
 
    Examples:
 
    1) STATIONS YES EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
       BATCH treats PT REYES' station position components as local parameters
       and all other station positions as global parameters.
 
    2) STATIONS NO EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
       BATCH treats PT REYES' station position components as global parameters
       and all other station positions as session parameters.
 
    3) STATIONS YES X-Z EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
       BATCH treats the station position components as follows:
 
       Stations other than PT REYES      PT REYES
 
 
       X components        Global        Local
       Y components        Local         Local
       Z components        Global        Local
 
     4) STATIONS NO -EN EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
        BATCH treats the station position components as follows:
 
                Stations other than PT REYES     PT REYES
       U components                 Local        Local
       E components                 Local        Global
       N components                 Local        Global
 
                4.2 CARRY.SOURCES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SOURCES      [YES or NO] {EXCEPT (source ...\)}
 
 
   The SOURCES keyword determines how BATCH treats the source coordinates
selected in the $FLAGS section.
 
   Field 1 -
 
           YES - treats every coordinate as a global parameter.
 
           NO  - treats every coordinate as an session parameter.
 
   Field 2 -
 
           If field 1 is YES/NO, BATCH treats the listed sources' coordinates
           as session/global parameters.  The sources must be upper case.
 
                4.3 CARRY.AXIS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {AXIS        [YES or NO]}
 
 
   The AXIS keyword determines how BATCH treats the axis offset parameter
selected in the $FLAGS section.
 
           YES - treats axis offsets for the stations specified in the
                 $FLAGS AXIS section as global parameters. NB: even if
                 position of a station are modeled by a linear spline or
                 had a break caused by episodic motion, only one antenna
                 axis offset for that station will be estimated.
 
           NO  - treats axis offsets for every station specified in the
                 $FLAGS AXIS section as session parameters.
 
  If the keyword is omitted, Solve assumes YES, i.e. treats axis offsets
for the stations specified in the $FLAGS AXIS section as global parameters.
NB: it is a good practice to specify all keywords and do not rely
on defaults.
 
 
        5 $DATA
        =======
 
 
   This section determines which data is included in the solution. To be
included, an observation must pass all of the criteria in this section.
 
                5.1 DATA.SOURCES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SOURCES      [YES or NO] {EXCEPT (source ...\)}
 
 
   This keyword specifies which sources may be included in the solution,
however, actually it is used for excluding some sources from appearance in
the solution. NB: these criteria are applied to all sessions.
 
   YES - includes all sources except any listed in the EXCEPT clause.
 
   NO  - excludes all sources except any listed in the EXCEPT clause.
 
                5.2 DATA.STATIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   STATIONS     [YES or NO] {EXCEPT (station ...\)}
 
 
   This keyword specifies which stations may be included in the solution,
however, actually it is used for deselecting some stations in the solution.
NB: these criteria are applied to all sessions. If you need to exclude
some stations in the specific session refer to ARCS.ARCFILE .
 
     YES - includes all stations except any listed in the EXCEPT clause.
 
     NO  - excludes all stations except any listed in the EXCEPT clause.
 
   Stations to be excluded take precedence over stations to be included,
if both types occur in an observation.
 
                5.3 DATA.BASELINES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{BASELINES  [YES or NO] {EXCEPT (<station-station> ... \)}}
 
 
    Uses to exclude or to include just only one or a set of baselines
in this solution.
 
    YES EXCEPT or EXCEPT - does not include baselines preceded by keyword
                           EXCEPT in solution.
 
    NO EXCEPT - just only include baselines preceded by keyword EXCEPT
                in solution.
 
    NO - (without any other qualifiers) means to take all baselines
 
    YES - (without any other qualifiers) means to take all baselines
 
NB: if you need to exclude some baselines in the specific experiment see
syntax of ARCS.ARCFILE
 
                5.4 DATA.TYPE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   TYPE      [GROUP_DELAYS_AND_RATES or GROUP_DELAYS_ONLY or
              PHASE_DELAYS_AND_RATES or PHASE_DELAYS_ONLY or
              GRPRAT or PHSRAT or SNBRAT or GRPONL or PHSONL or
              SNBONL or RATONL or  G_GXS or PX_GXS or PS_GXS or
               PX_GX or  PX_GS or  PS_GX or  PS_GS or  P_PXS or
                  GX or     GS or     PX or     PS]
 
 
   The TYPE keyword determines which type of data will be used. Solve supports
19 data types. The following values are the same and provided for compatibility:
GROUP_DELAYS_AND_RATES  and  GRPRAT,
GROUP_DELAYS_ONLY       and  GRPONL,
PHASE_DELAYS_AND_RATES  and  PHSRAT,
PHASE_DELAYS_ONLY       and  PHSONL
 
   Data type is applied to all sessions, but arc-list may override data type
for the specific session(s) for arc-list.
 
                5.5 DATA.ELEVATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {ELEVATION cutoff {EXCEPT cutoff (station ...\) {cutoff (station...\) ...}}}
 
 
   The ELEVATION keyword excludes observations in which one or both stations
observed the source at a lower elevation than is acceptable at the station.
 
   Field 1 (cutoff) -
 
          Uses this cutoff at every station not listed in the EXCEPT clause.
 
   Field 2 (EXCEPT clause) -
 
          The EXCEPT clause lists alternate cutoffs for specific stations.
 
   The cutoffs must contain decimal points (e.g., 5.0) and be specified in
degrees.
 
Example
 
     1) ELEVATION 8.0 EXCEPT 9.0 WESTFORD HATCREEK 0.0 KAUAI___ 7.5 PRESIDIO
 
     BATCH uses the following elevation cutoffs:
 
               KAUAI               None
               PRESIDIO            7.5 degrees
               WESTFORD,
                    HATCREEK       9 degrees
               Other stations      8 degrees
 
     2) ELEVATION 0.0
 
        BATCH uses all observations.
 
                5.6 DATA.WVR_MASK
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {WVR_MASK [NO or mask {EXCEPT mask (station ...\) {mask (station...\) ...}}]}
 
 
   This keyword was created for special applications. Most users will want to
use WVR_MASK NO .
 
   DBCAL, the program which adds weather data to an session, tries to add
WVR corrections to each observation in the session. However, the corrections
may have been obtained by methods of varying quality. For example, one
observation's corrections may have been actually taken during the observation,
while another observation's corrections may have been interpolated from
surrounding observations. The WVR_MASK keyword rejects observations in which
one or both stations' corrections were obtained by specified methods.
 
   If the qualifier mask is omitted - BATCH does not reject any observation
based on its WVR corrections.
 
   If the qualifier mask is included - BATCH uses one or more bit masks to
determine which methods to reject at which stations. Without an EXCEPT phrase,
the same mask is used for every station. Station(s) in the EXCEPT phrase use
the mask preceding them.
 
   Bit WVR masks of zero - BATCH does not reject any observation based on the
existence or quality of its WVR corrections.
 
   Non-zero WVR bit masks - each method is assigned a bit position within all
the masks. Within a specific station mask, the user sets the bit to zero to
reject or to one to accept observations corrected by that method. The following
table tells which bit controls which method. In addition, all non-zero masks
reject observations without WVR corrections. The bit masks must be specified
as octal numbers.
 
 
   Bit number    Method
 
       1         The WVR correction was measured during the observation within
                 2 degrees of the source.
 
       2         The correction was mapped from zenith measurements made during
                 the observation.
 
       3         The correction was measured during the observation, but more
                 than 2 degrees from the source.
 
       4         The correction was interpolated from the two closest available
                 observations. These observations are within 30 minutes of the
                 desired observation's mid-epoch.
 
       5         Same as bit 4, except that the observations used for
                 interpolation are more than 30 minutes from the desired
                 observation's mid-epoch.
 
       6         The correction was extrapolated from other WVR data. The
                 correction could not be interpolated because WVR data only
                 existed on one side of the desired observation.
 
       7         The method cannot be determined.
 
 
Example
 
     WVR_MASK 0 EXCEPT 32 WESTFORD 45 KAUAI___ MOJAVE12
                                   177 GILCREEK
 
     An octal 32 has bits 2, 4 and 5 set to one, so BATCH only accepts
observations at WESTFORD if their WVR corrections were mapped from zenith
measurements made during the observation, or interpolated.  (The data used
for the interpolation can be less than or greater than 30 minutes from each
observation's mid-epoch).  An octal 45 has bits 1, 3 and 6 set to one, so
BATCH only accepts observations at KAUAI and MOJAVE12 if their WVR corrections
were measured during the observation (either greater than or less than
2 degrees from the source), or extrapolated from other observations. BATCH
throws out observations at all three stations if they have no WVR correction
for the station. Bits 1 through 7 are all set to one in 177, so observations
at GILCREEK are acceptable, as long as they have some WVR correction at
GILCREEK. No criteria are applied for any other station.
 
                5.7 DATA.EVERY
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{EVERY [NO or (<N>  START  <M>)]}
 
 
   This keyword allows to reduce a data set by applying decimation: rejection
some portion of observations.
 
   NO -- means not to apply decimation
 
   Integer value - means that you wish to include only every Nth data point in
the solution, starting with the M-th point (where M <= N) For example,
EVERY 3 START 2 causes only data points 2, 5, 8, 3Xi-1, ... are taken
into account in solution.
 
                5.8 DATA.NORATE_FLAG
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   NORATE_FLAG [NO or YES]
 
 
   Solve may compute statistics for delay rate even if delay rate observables
were not used in the solution. Computation of delay rate statistics takes
additional time. If we don't need this kind of statistics we can bypass
this step.
 
   YES - Solve will not compute delay rate statistics.
 
   NO  - Solve will compute delay rate statistics.
 
NB: 1) NORATE_FLAG YES is not compatible with data types which require delay
       rate: GRPRAT or PHSRAT or SNBRAT or RATONL
    2) NORATE_FLAG YES cannot be used when a correction to weights is
       computed by using MYWAY algorithm.
 
 
        6 $CALIBRATIONS
        ===============
 
 
   This section specifies which station-dependent calibrations (e.g., cable,
Chao) and zenith path delay calibrations (e.g. NMFDRFLY, CFAKBDRY) BATCH
applies. It also determines whether BATCH applies the ionosphere calibration
and rejects observations with bad or missing S-band ionospheric values. The
main purpose of CALIBRATIONS keyword is to set uniform calibration setup
for all sessions. Each superfile keeps its own calibration setup, but it
may not be consistent with calibration setup of other superfiles. Keywords
of the section $CALIBRATIONS may force to set the same setup for all or some
calibrations.
 
   $CALIBRATIONS supports two syntax formats: the old (pre-MAY2000) and the
modern syntax (post-MAY2000). It is not recommended to use the old syntax.
 
                6.1 CALIBRATIONS.ION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  {ION     [ON or OFF or IN]}
 
 
   Determines the sessions to which BATCH applies the ionosphere calibration.
This phrase also determines the sessions for which BATCH rejects observations
with bad or missing S-band ionospheric values, subject to restrictions stated
below. The keyword ION is ignored when the data type is an ionosphere free
linear combination of several observables.
 
   ON  - applies the calibration to every session. Rejects every observation
         with bad or missing S-band values, except those flagged in the
         session's superfile as manually reweighted. (This flag indicates that
         the analyst who made the superfile solution wanted the observation
         included despite its bad values, for other reasons.)  Users are
         strongly advised to select this option unless you are analyzing very
         short baselines (say, shorter than 5 km) when we can totally neglect
         ionosphere contribution. The other options create the risk of letting
         observations with bad residuals into the solution.
 
   OFF - does not apply the calibration to any session. Accepts every
         observation with bad or missing S-band values, except those that have
         bad quality codes or were manually rejected in the superfile solution
         for other reasons.
 
   IN  - consults each session's superfile to decide whether to apply the
         calibration and reject or accept observations with bad values.
 
                6.2 CALIBRATIONS.RESET
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*(
   RESET [NO or YES]
*)
 
   This keyword determines whether station and zenith calibration should reset.
Resetting calibrations changes the meaning the following keywords: KEEP,
ENABLE, DISABLE. If the calibrations were not reset then KEEP, ENABLE and
DISABLE modifies calibration setup which was saved in the superfile. However,
if calibrations were reset then status of all calibrations is set to
"not available", "not applied" and the keywords KEEP, ENABLE, DISABLE change
the status of calibrations with respect "not available, not applied" status.
 
   NO  - not to reset calibrations
 
   YES - reset calibrations: to set status for all calibrations "not available",
         "not applied"
 
                6.3 CALIBRATIONS.KEEP
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  (KEEP    [NO or <calibration_name>]) ...
 
 
   Keyword KEEP forces BATCH to keep the status of the <calibration_name>
(station-dependent calibration or zenith calibration) the same as it is kept
in the superfile: "applied" or "not applied". If the <calibration_name> was not
found in the superfile, no actions is done and BATCH proceed silently.
 
   NO -- makes no effect.
 
   <calibration_name> - name of the calibrations. Supported calibrations are
                        listed
                        1) in the section 20 of CORFIL file (refer to
                           your $WORK_DIR/CORFxx file of
                           $SAVE_DIR/CORFIL.template)
                        2) in the file $SAVE_DIR/flyby_calibrations
 
 NB: More than one keyword KEEP is allowed but not more than MAX_CAL
     (constant defined in ../include/gsfcb.i, currently (2000.05.12) 15 )
 
                6.4 CALIBRATIONS.ENABLE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  (ENABLE  [NO or <calibration_name>]) ...
 
 
   Keyword ENABLE forces BATCH to set the status of the <calibration_name>
(station-dependent calibration or zenith calibration) "applied". If the
<calibration_name> was not found in the superfile, then BATCH issue a warning,
unless "WARNING NO" was specified in the $SETUP section and then proceed.
 
   NO -- makes no effect.
 
   <calibration_name> - name of the calibrations. Supported calibrations are
                        listed
                        1) in the section 20 of CORFIL file (refer to
                           your $WORK_DIR/CORFxx file of
                           $SAVE_DIR/CORFIL.template)
                        2) in the file $SAVE_DIR/flyby_calibrations
 
 NB: More than one keyword ENABLE is allowed but not more than MAX_CAL
     (constant defined in ../include/gsfcb.i, currently (2000.05.12) 15 )
 
                6.5 CALIBRATIONS.DISABLE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  (DISABLE [NO or <calibration_name>]) ...
 
 
   Keyword DISABLE forces BATCH to set the status of the <calibration_name>
(station-dependent calibration or zenith calibration) "Not applied". If the
<calibration_name> was not found in the superfile, then no action is made.
 
   NO -- makes no effect.
 
   <calibration_name> - name of the calibrations. Supported calibrations are
                        listed in
                        1) the section 20 of CORFIL file (refer to
                           your $WORK_DIR/CORFxx file of
                           $SAVE_DIR/CORFIL.template)
                        2) the file $SAVE_DIR/flyby_calibrations
 
 NB: More than one keyword DISABLE is allowed but not more than MAX_CAL
     (constant defined in ../include/gsfcb.i, currently (2000.05.12) 15 )
 
                6.6 CALIBRATIONS.DEFAULT
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  *DEFAULT
 
 
   DEFAULT tells to BATCH to handle the station-dependent calibrations and the
ionosphere calibration and editing in the ways recorded in each session's
superfile. Users who want to handle either issue differently must specify
a combination of the above phrases, as described below. Different keywords
are allowed in $CALIBRATIONS section. Usually ION and ALL corfile_display_name
keywords are specified.
 
   The remaining four phrases in this section (AVAILABLE, USE ...,
corfile_display_name ..., GROUP...) determine which calibrations BATCH applies.
 
   In all four phrases, corfile_display_name should be one of the names entered
in the first field in sections 10 and 20 of the LIPTN corfil ($WORK_DIR/CORFLP).
Only the first eight characters are significant. For example, to specify Marini
dry, the user should specify dry_Mari or dry_Marini, not MARI.DRY or MARISTAT.
Users should replace any blanks with '_'s (underscores). The suggested forms
of some commonly used calibrations are Chao, cable, dry_Marini, wet_Marini,
WVR, CFAKBDRY, CFAKBWET, CFA22DRY, and CFAJJDRY.
 
   When BATCH processes an session, it initially sets up the calibrations
the way they are set up in the session's superfile. BATCH then modifies that
set up according to the last three phrases in this section. First it turns
the specified calibrations in the corfile_display_name and GROUP phrases on
and off. Then it processes any USE phrases, substituting certain calibrations
for others if the latter are turned on after the other modifications.
 
   BATCH only performs whatever instructions it is given in this section.
It does not turn off one calibration when told to turn on a conflicting one.
For example, if an session's superfile has Marini dry turned on, and the user
wants to turn on CFAKBDRY instead, he/she must explicitly turn off Marini dry
or else use CFAKBDRY for Marini dry. If the user just turns on CFAKBDRY, BATCH
leaves marini dry on as well. So users should be careful to give BATCH a full
set of instructions covering every calibration which may be in their solutions'
superfiles. Specifying corfile_display_name ON or corfile_display_name OFF
for every calibration accomplishes this and is strongly recommended.
 
 
                6.7 CALIBRATIONS.AVAILABLE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{[AVAILABLE or (AVAILABLE corfile_display_name ...\)]}
 
 
   Keyword AVAILABLE determines which flyby calibrations are currently
available.
 
   The available flyby calibrations are now listed in flycal_avail on
$SAVE_DIR. AVAILABLE tells to BATCH to read this file.  For backwards
compatibility, AVAILABLE can still be followed by a list of flyby calibrations.
However, BATCH now ignores the list.
 
   Whenever a standard flyby calibration is missing from flycal_avail, users
should consult a SOLVE programmer or check the socal subroutine before entering
the calibration again. The calibration may be temporarily disabled due to
problems.
 
   Users should always specify this phrase. BATCH cannot use flyby calibrations
without it, and it has no harmful effects in solutions which do not use flyby
calibrations.
 
                6.8 CALIBRATIONS.CORFILE_DISPLAY_NAME
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{(corfile_display_name [ON or OFF or IN]
                          {[ALL or NONE] {EXCEPT station ...\}}) ...}
 
 
This phrase turns or leaves individual calibrations on or off.
 
     Field 1 - the calibration.
 
     Field 2 - the instructions.
 
          ON - turns the calibration on in every session.  If the calibration
               is not available to an session, BATCH aborts.
 
          OFF - turns the calibration off in every session.
 
          DEFAULT - leaves the calibration the way it is set in each session's
                    superfile.
 
     Field 3 - the stations affected. The default is all stations.
 
          ALL - affects every station except those listed in the optional
                EXCEPT clause.
 
          NONE - only affects stations listed in the (optional) EXCEPT clause.
 
   Users are strongly advised to use this phrase to explicitly turn EVERY
calibration on or off at every station. Otherwise users may make incorrect
assumptions about which calibrations BATCH is using, and they may experience
cases in which an session has no calibration or too many calibrations turned on.
 
                6.9 CALIBRATIONS.GROUP
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{(GROUP corfile_display_name ...
            [(PICK DEFAULT) or
            ((PICK corfile_display_name ...)
              {{ELSE corfile_display_name ...} ...}
                {ELSE DEFAULT} )]
                {STATIONS {[ALL or NONE] {EXCEPT station ...\}}} \) ...}
 
 
   This phrase tells to BATCH how to set up a group of calibrations. (BATCH may
turn some on and the rest off or leave them all the way each session's
superfile set them up.)
 
     Field 1 (GROUP corfile_display_name ... ) - the calibrations in the group.
 
     Field 2 (PICK DEFAULT ... ELSE DEFAULT) - the instructions.
 
     PICK/ELSE DEFAULT - leaves each calibration the way it is set in each
                         session's superfile.
 
     PICK/ELSE corfile_display_name(s) - must be a subset of the list in
               field 1. BATCH turns on this subset and turns off the remaining
               calibrations in the group.
 
     If BATCH cannot turn on every calibration in a given subset, it will try
the series of alternate subsets specified in ELSE phrases, until it finds one
that works or finds an ELSE DEFAULT. If BATCH runs out of ELSE phrases without
finding a usable subset or DEFAULT, it aborts.
 
     Field 3 - the stations affected. The default is all stations.
 
     ALL - affects every station except those listed in the optional EXCEPT
           clause.
 
     NONE - only affects stations listed in the (optional) EXCEPT clause.
 
                6.10 CALIBRATIONS.USE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{(USE corfile_display_name FOR corfile_display_name)        ...}
 
 
   After BATCH uses the other phrases to set up an session's calibrations,
if the second calibration in this phrase is turned on, BATCH turns on the first
one instead.  If the substitute is not available or is already turned on,
BATCH aborts.
 
   If the second calibration is not turned on, this phrase has no effect.
 
Examples
 
     GROUP dry_Mari wet_Mari WVR PICK dry_Mari wet_Mari ELSE dry_Mari
 
     BATCH first tries to turn on dry and wet Marini and turn off the WVR
calibration.  If one or both of the Marini calibrations are unavailable in
an session, BATCH tries to turn on dry Marini alone. If this is unavailable,
BATCH aborts.
 
     ELSE DEFAULT
 
     Appending ELSE DEFAULT to the previous example makes sure that BATCH does
not abort, if the PICK and ELSE selections fail. However, this is a mixed
blessing.  What BATCH turns on in this case depends on what was turned on in
the session's superfile solution.  Dry (and probably therefore wet) Marini are
out of the picture, leaving the WVR calibration. If this was on in the
solution, BATCH leaves it on, replacing the desired Marini calibrations with
one the user didn't request and may not notice being used for the session.
If WVR was off, BATCH leaves it off, probably leaving the session without any
calibrations, since the user presumably did not choose any other calibrations
if he/she was hoping to get the Marini calibrations.
 
 
        7 $PARTIALS
        ===========
 
 
    This section specifies which partials with respect to atmosphere wet
path delay BATCH should use.
 
                7.1 PARTIALS.SET
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SET} <partial_name> {ON}
 
 
   Set the model according to which partial derivatives wrt atmosphere path
delay should be computed. The name of the model should be one of the names
listed in the file $SAVE_DIR/partial_calibrations.
 
NB: Two syntax format allowed:
    1)  the obsolete: partial_name ON
    2)  the modern:   SET <partial_name>
 
NB: partial names are case sensitive!
 
 
        8 $CONTRIBUTIONS
        ================
 
 
   This section determines which contributions BATCH applies to an session.
Contribution are corrections to delay and delay rate which were computed,
stored in the superfile but not yet added to the theoretical delay and/or
delay rate.
 
 
                8.1 CONTRIBUTIONS.SET
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  ({SET} [NO or NONE or IN or <contribution_name> ...] )
 
 
   The keyword SET specifies what contributions should be applied.
 
   NO - means that no contribution should be applied. Only one keyword with
        qualifier NO is allowed in the section $CONTRIBUTIONS.
 
   NONE - the same as NO
 
   IN - applies whatever contributions are stored in each session's superfile.
        Only one keyword with qualifier NO is allowed in the section
        $CALIBRATIONS.
 
   SET - applies the listed contributions to every session and doesn't apply
         any other calibration not listed in the section $CONTRIBUTIONS. More
         than one SET keywords are allowed. Thus, if you are going apply several
         contributions, it is better to puit several SET-statments, one
         statement for each contribution.
 
   <contribution_name> - is the name of the calibration. The list of supported
names can be in section 40 of the corfil used for making superfiles ( f.e.
$WORK_DIR/CORFLP ). BATCH applies only the contributions specified by
keywords SET and doesn't apply contribution not listed there. If at least
one contribution is specified in the control file but not found in the
superfile, BATCH will issues an error message and terminate.
 
   NB: '_' (Underscore character) should be used instead of blank if the
contribution contains a blank. For example, to specify pole tide, the user
should specify Pol_Tide, not PTD CONT.
 
   NB: contribution names are case sensitive!
 
 
        9 $MODE_CALIBRATIONS
        ====================
 
 
   This section determines which mode calibration should be applied to each
session. Mode calibrations are the calibrations which are depends on
a) band; b) observable type. 6 quantities are computed for each mode
calibrations: Mode calibration for
 
1) Group delay observable at X-band;
2) Phase delay observable at X-band;
3) Delay rate observable at X-band;
4) Group delay observable at S-band;
5) Phase delay observable at S-band;
6) Delay rate observable at S-band.
 
                9.1 MODE_CALIBRATIONS.SET
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  ({SET} [NO or NONE or IN or <mode_calibration_name> ...] ... )
 
 
   The keyword SET specifies what mode calibrations should be applied.
 
   NO - BATCH does not apply any contribution to any session. Only one keyword
        with qualifier NO is allowed in the section $MODE_CALIBRATIONS.
 
   NONE - the same as NO
 
   IN - applies whatever mode calibration are applied in each session's
        superfile. Only one keyword with qualifier IN is allowed in the
        section $MODE_CALIBRATIONS.
 
   SET - apply the mode_calibration specified and don't apply any mode
         calibration not listed. More than one keyword SET is allowed in
         the section $MODE_CALIBRATIONS.
 
   <mode_calibration_name> - is the name of the mode calibration. The list of
supported names can be in section 50 of the corfil used for making superfiles
( f.e. $WORK_DIR/CORFLP ).
 
   NB: mode calibrations names are case sensitive!
 
        10 $MAPPING
        ===========
 
 
   This section replaces a priori calculated from a standard theoretical model
and read from the sessions' superfiles with alternate a priori. This process
is called mapping. All keywords from the section contains a value
file_descriptor. If the first character of the <file_descriptor> is "/"
then the name is interpreted as a name with absolute path. Otherwise the
prefix $SAVE_DIR/ is prepended before the name. By the another words BATCH
seeks the files in $SAVE_DIR directory unless full file name including path
is specified. Restriction: the full file name after expansion should have
no more than 128 symbols. It is strongly recommended ALWAYS to use mapping
files for ALL stations, ALL sources for all kind of solutions. Superfiles may
contain different a priori for the same stations, sources in different
sessions. If Solve detects such a situation it terminates the run.
 
                10.1 MAPPING.STATIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   STATIONS        [NONE or file_name]
 
 
   Determines a priori file of station positions used in BATCH solution.
 
   Field 1 -
             NONE - BATCH uses the superfiles' positions for every station.
                    file_name - file, a priori positions BATCH are read from.
 
             Each line of file_name must give a station followed by X, Y and Z
             components, in meters. If file_name does not list a station, BATCH
             uses its superfile position.  Comments may be placed anywhere in
             the file preceded by $$.
 
                10.2 MAPPING.PLATE_MODEL
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   PLATE_MODEL     [NONE or ( [AM0-2 or NUVEL]
                              {REF_DATE <date>}
                             *{SCALE scaling_factor} *{FIX plate_name} ) ]
 
 
   Determines plate model used in solution. Field 1 and field 2 have similar
meaning as STATIONS' in this section.
 
     Field 1 - the model.
 
          AM0-2 - the AM0-2 model.
 
          NUVEL - the NUVEL model.
 
     Field 2 - reference epoch.
 
               date specified - uses the given date, which must be
               in the yymmdd format.
 
               date omitted - uses October 17, 1980.
 
     SCALE - scales the magnitude of baseline length by scaling_factor.
 
     FIX - requested plate has zero velocity.
 
                10.3 MAPPING.VELOCITIES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   VELOCITIES      [NONE or file_name] {REF_DATE <date>}
 
 
   Determines a priori file of station velocities used in BATCH solution.
 
    Field 1 -
            NONE - does not use a priori values,
 
            file_name - file, a priori values are read from.
 
 
    Field 2 -
            REF_DATE - reference epoch of the
 
              date specified - uses that date, which must be in the
                               yymmdd format.
 
              date omitted - the date from the velocity file will be used
                             as a reference date.
 
   Each line in the VELOCITIES file except the fist line should give a station
and X, Y and Z velocities (in mm/year) formatted as
(4X, 4A2, 1X, D15.11, 1X, D15.11, 1X, D15.11). BATCH assigns unlisted stations
a velocity of zero, although it is a bad practice. If Solve doesn't find
the station in the velocity substitution file it issues a warning (unless
a keyword WARNING was set to NO in the $SETUP section). Comments may be placed
anywhere within the file, preceded by $$. The first line of a valid velocity
substitution file contains a reference epoch data in the format YYYY.MM.DD
(f.e. 2000.05.08 ) or yymmmdd (f.e. 970101)
 
   In both methods(PLATE_MODEL and VELOCITIES, BATCH assumes that every
station started at a specific position at the reference epoch. If this
sections STATIONS keyword specifies a file, BATCH uses its positions for the
reference positions of the stations in that file. BATCH uses the superfile
positions for the remaining stations or if STATIONS is NONE.
 
NB: VELOCITY and PLATE_MODEL cannot be used both.
 
                10.4 MAPPING.SOURCES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SOURCES         [NONE or file_name]
 
 
   The SOURCES keyword replaces the superfile source coordinates with
coordinates from a file. Field 1 and field 2 have similar meaning as in
STATIONS in this section.
 
   Each line of file_name should give a source name, right ascension (in hours,
minutes and seconds) and declination (in degrees, minutes and seconds).
To specify a southern (negative declination) source, the user should start
the degree field of the declination with a negative sign. Comments may be
placed anywhere in the file, preceded by $$.
 
The following is a partial example of a source mapping file:

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   EARTH_ORIENTATION  [NONE or file_name] {[LIN or CUB or SPL]}
                     {[UT1R or UT1S or NO_ZONAL]}
 
 
   The EARTH_ORIENTATION keyword replaces the a priori earth orientation
parameters: pole coordinates and UT1 with parameters interpolated from the
external time series.
 
     NONE - uses the EOP saved in the superfile.
 
     file_name - BATCH interpolates the X- and Y-wobble and UT1-TAI
                 time series contained in file_name.
 
     Field 2 - interpolation algorithm.
 
               LIN - linear
 
               CUB - cubic polynomial
 
               SPL - cubic interpolating spline with free ends
 
     Field 3 - how to treat variations of UT1 induced by zonal tides for
               interpolating external file.
 
               UT1R - the difference UT1R-UT1 in accordance with the table of
                      Yoder, Williams, and Parke, 1981, "Tidal Variations of
                      Earth Rotation", J. Geophys. Res., Vol. 86, p. 881-891
                      are subtracted from the external file before
                      interpolating and then added after interpolating.
 
               UT1R - the difference UT1S-UT1 in accordance with the table of
                      Dickman (1991) are subtracted from the external file
                      before interpolating and then added after interpolating.
 
               NO_ZONAL - direct interpolation without subtracting
                          contribution due to zonal tide.
 
    BATCH expects the three series to contain the same dates. The first line
of an external EOP file should give the dates the series cover, specified as
the series' starting (Julian) date, the interval between dates (in days) and
the number of dates. Each remaining line should give a successive date,
followed by its X-wobble, Y-wobble and UT1 offsets, X-wobble, Y-wobble and
UT1 sigmas and X- Y, X-U and Y-U correlations.  X-wobble and Y-wobble should
be given in deci-arcseconds. UT1 should be in microseconds of time. A comment
may be appended to the first line, starting in column 18.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   NUTATION_SERIES    [NONE or file_name]
 
 
   This keyword substitutes corrections the a priori values of nutation in
longitude and nutation in obliquity angles by interpolated from a time series
supplied by external file. Linear interpolation between adjacent nodes is used.
NB: external file should contain corrections with respect to the nutation
angles used as a priori. Different versions of CALC used different a priori
nutation models. BE CAUTIOUS!
 
     NONE - uses the superfile a prioris.
 
     file_name - BATCH linearly interpolates the nutation in longitude and
                 nutation in obliquity time series contained in file_name.
 
     The first line of the external file should give the first Julian date in
the time series, the interval between the series' dates (in days) and the
number of dates in the series. The remaining lines should give successive dates
in the series, followed by the longitude offset and sigma, obliquity offset and
sigma and the correlation between the longitude and obliquity offsets, at that
date. The offsets and sigmas must be given in .0001 arcseconds. A comment may
be appended to the first line, starting in column 22.

                10.7 MAPPING.SPLINE_DISPLACEMENTS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   SPLINE_DISPLACEMENTS
     [NONE or
      (BSP (file_name))...
     ]
 
 
  Keyword  SPLINE_DISPLACEMENT  specifies the files(s) with the models
for displacement for one or more sites models with expansion with the
B-spline basis. The model contains the station name, station apriroi
coordinates, degree of the B-spline basis, the epoch of each node and
coefficients of expansion on the B-spline basis over these nodes for
X, Y and Z components of site coordinates.
 
         BSP -- qualifiers indicating that its value specifies the model
                of displacement for a specific site in BSP format.
                One BSP file contains  set of coefficients for one
                site. Refer to specifications of BSP format in
                $MK5_ROOT/help/bsppos_format.txt

                displacement for a specific site.
 
 
                10.8 MAPPING.EPISODIC_MOTION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{EPISODIC_MOTION   [NONE or file_name]}
 
 
   This is obsolecent keyword. Use SPLINE_POS instead of it.
 
   The EPISODIC_MOTION keyword tells to Solve to estimate a break in station
positions of global station at the specified epochs. It is assumed that the
station position has a discontinuity(ies) at the epoch of break(s) for
some reasons, e.g., due to earthquake or rails repairing or whatever other
reasons. If one break epoch is specified then two estimates of station positions
are adjusted: the first estimates is obtained over all observations before
the break epoch and the second station positions are estimated over all
observations after the clock break. But the estimates of velocity doesn't have
breaks, so if station velocity is adjusted then it is adjusted over all
observations both before the break and after the break. Unlimited number of
breaks can be specified but at least one sessions with good observations at
the station under consideration should take place between the epochs of
clock breaks.
 
   Keyword EPISODIC_MOTION is ignored for INDEPENDENT solution types or for
the stations those positions are considered as local parameters. This
keyword is incompatible with PIECE_WISE_STA and SPLINE_POS keywords.
 
   NONE - estimates every station's position components as specified in the
          $FLAGS and $CARRY STATIONS keywords (as local parameters or as one
          set of global components based on every session in the solution).
 
   file_name - BATCH estimates each listed station's components at the listed
               epochs, as well as at the start of the experiment. BATCH
               estimates the position at each epoch based on the data in the
               interval between it and the next epoch.
 
   The user must treat each listed station's position components as global
parameters. BATCH estimates the components in whatever coordinate system is
given in the $FLAGS section's STATIONS keyword.
 
   Each line in file_name must list a station (columns 1 - 8) and an epoch
(columns 10 - 15). Comments may occur anywhere in the file, preceded by an
asterisk.
 
   This keyword does not affect the way BATCH estimates velocities.
 
   Although this keyword is in the $MAPPING section, it does not affect which
a prioris BATCH uses.
 
The following is an example of an episodic motion mapping file:
 
* This is a file containing information about episodic site motion
* Each line contains a station name in columns 1-8, and a date on
* which episodic motion occurred at that station in columns 10-15

                10.9 MAPPING.ECCENTRICITY
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {ECCENTRICITY      [NONE or file_name]}
 
 
   This keyword allows user to apply an eccentricity substitution file.
The eccentricity file defines a vector from the dome reference points to the
antenna reference point for each station for the specified interval of time.
Solve supports eccentricity file format ECC v. 1.0 . The purpose of the
eccentricity file is to model slow local motion of the antenna with respect to
the local marks. Originally this file was designed for specifying eccentricity
vector for mobile stations for each campaign. However, each station should
have at least one record (eccentricity is usually set to zero for fixed
antennas) and each antenna, including large fixed antennas, may have proper
local motion, e.g. due to antenna rail repairing, post-seismic notion or
whatever reason an analyst finds appropriate.
 
   The values of eccentricity vectors from the external eccentricity file
supersedes eccentricity values saved in the superfile.
 
   Each valid eccentricity file of ECC-format v 1.0 has the first line
# ECC-FORMAT V 1.0   ECCENTRICITY FILE
   and the last line
# ECC-FORMAT V 1.0   ECCENTRICITY FILE (trailing line)
 
   Lines with the first symbol $ are considered as comments and ignored. Other
lines should contain definitions of eccentricity vector for each epoch:
$  ( 3:10)  IVS station name
$  (12:15)  Monument number
$  (18:33)  Starting date of validity of the eccentricity vector
$           (18:21)  Year  of starting date of validity
$           (23:24)  Month of starting date of validity
$           (26:27)  Day of month of starting date of validity
$           (29:30)  Hour (UTC) of starting date of validity
$           (32:33)  Minute (UTC) of starting date of validity
$  (36:51)  Ending date of validity of validity of the eccentricity vector
$           (36:39)  Year  of ending date of validity
$           (41:42)  Month of ending date of validity
$           (44:45)  Day of month of ending date of validity
$           (47:48)  Hour (UTC) of ending date of validity
$           (50:51)  Minute (UTC) of ending date of validity
$  (54:63)  First coordinate of eccentricity (in meters)
$  (65:74)  Second coordinate of eccentricity (in meters)
$  (76:85)  Third coordinate of eccentricity (in meters)
$  (88:90)  Type of eccentricity data. Set meaning of eccentricity coordinates.
$           Two types are supported:
$           NEU  -- 1-st coordinate is a north projection;
$                   2-nd coordinate is an east projection;
$                   3-rd coordinate is a vertical projection directed up
$                        (more precisely speaking it is directed along
$                         a normal to the ellipsoid)
$           XYZ  -- 1-st coordinate is a X-coordinate in crust fixed system;
$                   2-nd coordinate is a Y-coordinate in crust fixed system;
$                   3-rd coordinate is a Z-coordinate in crust fixed system.
 
NB: Solve before 1999.10.15 kept eccentricity vector only up to 1mm.
Discrepancies in the estimates of positions of some stations when an
eccentricity file in the ECC v 1.0 format is used may reach 0.7mm due to
rounding errors.

               phases, frequencies, accelations, cosine and since
               components of a 3D small rotation. This file can
               contain constituents of tidally induces high frequency
               EOP variations, nutation and ad hoc non-tidal harmonic
               varitaions in EOP. Format description is in file
               $MK5_ROOT/help/heo_format.txt
 
   Comment: this keyword is incompatible with HI_FREQ_EOP
 
   NB: when HARMONIC_EOP is in use, then the line in the listing
       "EOP corrected for hi-freq variations  (a-sigmas) VLBI solution"
       may be wrong, since Solve does not distingish between prograde
       in retrograde (nutation) variations in EOP.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {PRESSURE_LOADING [NONE or file_name]}
 
 
   Determines a priori file atmospheric pressure loading which defines
apriori regression model of atmosphere pressure loading. According to that
model pressure loading is considered to be proportional local atmosphere
pressure. The coefficients of this model are determined by fitting to
either VLBI data or to the pressure loading series computed on the basis
of a meteorological model. Contributions of the modeled atmosphere pressure
loading to delay and delay rate are applied to the data.
 
   NONE - no contributions due to atmospheric pressure loading are applied.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {PIECE_WISE_STA   [NONE or file_name]}
 
 
   Determines the list stations whose positions are modeled by linear spline
(continuous piece-wise function) and the time span. Positions of
some station can be estimated each nnn days. The keyword PIECE_WISE_STA
specifies the list of such stations. This keyword is incompatible with
EPISODIC_MOTION and SPLINE_POS keywords.
 
   NONE - no station positions will be estimated as piece-wise function.
 
   file_name - the requested file name.
 
   Format of the piece-wise station control file:
 
yymmdd <interval> <number_of_epochs>
<station_1>
<station_2>

<station_n>
 
  where  yymmdd            -- data of the first epoch at 00 hours in scale TDB.
        <interval>         -- interval between the nodes in calendar months.
        <number_of_epochs> -- number of nodes of linear spline
 
Example:
 
800901 1 65
HRAS 085
 
  It means that position of the station "HRAS 085" will be models by linear
spline with nodes 01-SEP-80, 01-OCT-80, 01-NOV-80, 01-DEC-80 etc.,
in total 65 nodes.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {METRIC_TENSOR [NONE or IERS92 or GRS or TOPOCNTR]}
 
 
   This keyword enables to apply correction to theoretical time delay due
to changes in metric tensor for geocentric reference frame. NB: Calc 9.12
and earlier (and, probably, released after 2001.01.16) uses INCORRECT formula
for geometric time delay, namely, the formula presented in the IERS
Conventions, 1992. This formula is not consistent with any known metric of
geocentric reference frame and with formulas used for analysis of GPS, SLR
and other geodetic techniques. Using this erroneous formula leads to systematic
changes in scale.
 
    NONE     -- no correction is done. Theoretical time delay and delay rate are
                used as taken from Calc.
 
    IERS92   -- peculiar metric IERS92-VLBI is used.
 
    GRS      -- GRS metric as defined in the IERS Conventions 2000 or as
                in the recommendation B.1 in the resolution adopted at
                the 24-th General Assembly of IAU in 2000, adopted at the
                180-th IAU Symposium.
                NB: This metric consistent with formulas for pseudo-range
                used for processing SLR, GPS and other observations.
 
    TOPOCNTR -- Topocentric metric for the first station is used. This metric
                is consistent with the expression for VLBI delay published
                in IERS Conventions 1996.

                         [LINEAR or SPLINE] [REQUIRED or IF_AVAILABLE] ...) ]
 
 
   This keyword enables to apply external models of site position variations.
The model can be presented either in the form of the set of coefficients
for sine and cosine amplitudes for Up, East and North components of the
displacement vector for each site for a finite set of harmonics or
in the form of time series of X, Y and Z component of the displacement vector
for each site. If more than one model is specified, then the contribution of
the sum of the displacements is applied to the delay and delay rates. Up to
8 models can be specified. More details about this option can be found in
$MK5_ROOT/help/posvar.txt
 
    NONE     -- no site position variations model is defined
 
    Field 1  -- external file -- specifies either the file name with harmonic
                site position variations model in HARPOS format, or the
                name of the directory with the set of files with time series
                of site position variations with each site in BINDISP binary
                format. That directory should also have the summary file of
                the time series position variation model. If the path to the
                file is omitted, then the directory name from $SAVE_DIR is
                prepended before the external file name.
 
    Filed 2  -- one of HARMONIC_MODEL (short form HMD is also accepted) or
                TIME_SERIES (short form TSR is also accepted). This qualifier
                specifies the type of the model: harmonic site position
                variations model or time series. In the case of
                HARMONIC_MODEL it is assumed that the external_file field
                specifies the name of the file in HARPOS format. In the case
                of TIME_SERIES it is assumed that the external_file field
                specifies the directory where files in BINDISP format for
                all sites are located as well as the file in BINDISP_SUMMARY
                format which keeps the summary of the contents of that
                directory.
 
    Filed 3  -- one of LINEAR (short form LIN is also accepted) or SPLINE
                (short form SPL is also accepted). This field specifies the
                type of interpolation used for computing site displacement
                at the epoch of the observation. Site displacement first are
                computed at the sequence of nodes around the time range of
                the session. In the case of harmonic model, displacements are
                computed directly at the epochs of the nodes, in the case of
                time series, an interpolation scheme defined in the field
                3 is used. Then the displacements computed for that sequence
                of nodes are interpolated again to the time epoch of each
                individual observation.
 
    Filed 4  -- one of REQUIRED (short form REQ is also accepted) or
                IF_AVAILABLE (short form AVL is also accepted ). This field
                defines the action in the case if harmonic site position
                variations turned out to be not defined for one or several
                stations. It can occur for two reasons: 1) no sites closed
                enough to the VLBI station participated in the particular
                experiment is found in the external file(s); 2) time series
                of site position variations are defined for the time range
                which does not include the time range of the particular
                experiment. If the action REQUIRED is specified, Solve issues
                the error message and terminates abnormally. If the action
                IF_AVAILABLE is specified, then in the case if for some
                sessions site position displacements for one ore more stations
                are not defined, Solve sets apriori displacement for these
                sites and these sessions to zero and proceeds. If the option
                WARNING in the $SETUP section was specified ON, then Solve
                prints a warning message in the screen and in the spool file.

external files with the path delay in the neutral atmosphere and its
partial derivative with respect to the atmosphere path delay in
zenith direction, as well as parital derivatives with respect to
the tilts of the atmosphere axis of symmetry are  located. At present,
fioles in TROPO_PATH_DELAY format are supported.

                                [NONE or insitu_file_name)]
 
 
  The keyword  ANTENNA_THERMAL  forces Solve to compute the contribution
to delay caused by thermal expansion of the antenna structure.
 
  Field 1
 
  NONE  -- not to use this feature;
 
  MODEL -- tells to BATCH that the model of the antenna thermal expansion

                          VLBI experiments. The contribution to delay
                          caused by thermal expansion will not be computed

                          will NOT be computed for these stations.
                          It is assumed that thermal expansion for
                          these antennas will be treated as site position
                          variations. The purporse of this file is to
                          avoid accounting for thermal expansion more
                          than once.
 
        11 $CONSTRAINTS
        ===============
 
 
   The $CONSTRAINTS section constrains specific parameter estimates.
 
   The keyword NONE means to estimates every parameter without constraints.
To constrain parameters, the user must select one or more keywords.
 
NB: Special care should be taken when using options in $CONSTRAINTS
A user should understand clearly what he/she is going. BATCH checks only
syntax. It is very easy to get completely wrong results when suppression is
used incorrectly!
 
NB: constrains on user parameters are imposed by the different way.
 
                11.1 CONSTRAINTS.EARTH_ORIENTATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {EARTH_ORIENTATION [ IN or NO or
                        ( YES {SIGMA x_s_mas y_s_mas u_s_ms} *{FACTOR sigfact}
                          *{RATES
                            [NO or { SIGMA x_s_mas/day y_s_mas/day u_s_ms/day}]}
                        ) ]
 
 
   The keyword EARTH_ORIENTATION constrains the earth orientation parameters:
pole coordinates and UT1.
 
   Field 1 -
 
            IN - constrains are imposed on UT1 and pole coordinates. Sigmas
                 of constraints and correlations between EOP are taken
                 from the apriori EOP file.
 
            NO - does not constrain any of the offsets.
 
           YES - constrains all three offsets. No correlation between EOP will
                 be used.
 
 
  Field 2 (after YES) - determines the sigmas of constraints and the
                        correlations BATCH uses to constrain the EOP.
 
  Field 2 (after YES) omitted - uses the sigmas and correlations from the
                                earth orientation mapping file.
 
  Field 2 after YES specified - If the user selected a mapping file, uses the
                    file's correlations and the root sum squares of the listed
                    sigmas and the mapping file's sigmas. Otherwise, BATCH uses
                    the listed sigmas and sets the correlations to zero.
                    x_s_mas and y_s_mas must be in milliarcseconds, and u_s_ms
                    must be in milliseconds of time.
 
  Field 3 after YES - to scale the formal errors in file
                      $MAPPING.EARTH_ORIENTATION
 
  Field 4 after YES - determines the constraints imposed on rate of change
                      of EOP.
 
                      NO - no constraints
 
  Field 5 after YES - determines the sigmas (constraints) and the correlations
                      BATCH uses to constrain the rate of change of EOP.
 
   If the user does not select a mapping file, he/she must specify the first
field YES and list values in field 2. Otherwise, BATCH produces unpredictable
results.
 
   The NO_EOP_CONSTRAINT field in the $ARCS section disables these constraints
for individual sessions.
 
   These constraints should not be confused with the constraints in the $FLAGS
section's UT1/PM keyword. Those constraints apply to earth orientation rates
under a specific parameterization scheme, linear spline, while constrains in
$CONSTRAINS section apply the estimates of EOP (and rate of change) adjusted
over all observations of the session.
 
                11.2 CONSTRAINTS.NUTATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{NUTATION         [YES or NO] {SIGMA} {psi_mas eps_mas}}
 
 
   Constraints on the estimates of daily offsets of nutation angles: nutation
in longitude and nutation in obliquity.
 
   Field 1 -
           YES - applies constraints to nutation
 
           NO - does not apply constraints to nutation
 
   Field 2 - determines the sigmas of the constraints imposed on the estimates
             of daily nutation offset in longitude and in obliquity. Units
             are milliarcseconds.
 
                11.3 CONSTRAINTS.ATMOSPHERES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                (YES constraint_in_ps/hour
                {EXCEPT constraint_in_ps/hour station})]}
 
 
    The ATMOSPHERES keyword imposes constraints on the coefficients of linear
spline modeling atmosphere zenith path delay for each station by such a manner
that the rate of change of linear spline between each adjacent segments is
constrained to zero.
 
     NO - does not constrain any rate at any station for any session.
 
     IN - uses the constraints sigmas kept in the session's superfile. If
          an session does not have constraints for a station, that station's
          atmosphere rates are unconstrained for that session.
 
     WEAKEST - uses the constraint sigma which is the maximum between the
               specified constraint and the constraint for that station saved
               in the superfile. By another words, the requested constraint
               sigma will be used unless a weaker (larger sigma) constraint
               sigma was saved in the superfile. The requested constraint
               must be given in picoseconds/hour.
 
     MOST    - uses the constraint sigma which is the maximum between the
 
     YES - uses the requested constraint for all stations for all sessions
           regardless of any constraints in the sessions' superfiles.
 
     EXCEPT - specifies a different constraint for a single station.
              Both of the requested constraints must be given in
              picoseconds/hour.
 
     station - station name.
 
                11.4 CONSTRAINTS.CLOCKS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                      {EXCEPT constraint_in_parts_in_1.d-14 station})]}
 
 
    The CLOCKS keyword imposes constraints on coefficients of linear spline
modeling clock function for each station except the reference one by such
a manner that the rate of change of linear spline between each adjacent
segments is constrained to zero.
 
    NO - does not constrain any clock rate at any station for any session.
 
    IN - uses the constraint sigmas kept in the session's superfile. If an
         session does not have constraints for a station, then Solve will
         terminated abnormally since normal matrix will be singular.
 
    WEAKEST - uses the constraint sigma which is the maximum between the
              specified constraint and the constraint for that station saved
              in the superfile. By another words, the requested constraint
              sigma will be used unless a weaker (larger sigma) constraint was
              sigma saved in the superfile. The requested constraint must
              be given in 10**-14
    MOST    - the same as WEAKEST
 
    YES - uses the requested constraint for all stations for all
          sessions regardless of any constraints in the sessions' superfiles.
 
    EXCEPT - specifies a different constraint for a single station. Both
             of the requested constraints must be given in 10**-14

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   *{GRADIENTS        [NO or (YES  <offset_const_mm>  <rate_const_mm/day>)]}
 
 
   This keyword imposes constraints on the estimates of atmosphere path delay
gradients. Constraints are imposed on both gradient offset and gradient rate.
 
   NO  - no gradients constraints.
 
   YES - to impose atmospheric gradients constraints.

             that no constraint for this component is imposed.
 
   <offset_const_mm>   - specifies sigma of constraints imposed on gradient
                         offset.
   <rate_const_mm/day> - specifies sigma of constraints imposed on gradient
                         rate.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   IONOSPHERE_SCALE [NO or (YES SIGMA value)]
 
 
   This keyword imposes constraints on the estimates of the ionosphere
scale.
 
   NO    - no ionosphere scale constraint (default).
 
   YES   - to impose constraint on inosphere scale.
 
   SIGMA - specifies sigma of constraint for ionospere scale.
           The scale is dimensionless.
 
   valie - the value of the reciprocal weigtht (or sigma) for
           ionospere scale estimates.

   Determines whether to impose constraints on station positions. This keyword
allows to impose either no constraints (STATIONS NO) or constraints only
on XYZ (X-coordinate, Y-coordinate and Z-coordinate) components of station
positions or constraints only on UEN (Up East North) components of station
positions or on both. By another words constraints may be set up twice: first
on XYZ component and in addition on UEN components. The optional EXCEPT list
for XYZ constraints and for UEN constraints may be different. NB: both UEN and
XYZ qualifiers must present unless "VELOCITIES NO" form is used.
 
   NO      - no constraints on station positions are imposed.
 
   XYZ NO  - no constraints are imposed on XYZ components of station positions.
 
   UEN NO  - no constraints are imposed on UEN components of station positions.
 
   XYZ YES - constraints are imposed on XYZ components of station positions.
 
   UEN YES - constraints are imposed on UEN components of station positions.

   constraints are imposed on X-component of station coordinates with sigma
   10 meters, on Y-component of station coordinates and on z-component
   of coordinates for all stations except HRAS_085. In addition constrains
   on East-projection of station coordinates and on North-projection
   of coordinates of HRAS 085 only are imposed. Since the name of the station
   HRAS 085 contained the blank, it MUST be replaced with underscore character.

   This keyword allows to impose constraints on rate of change of station
position modeled by linear spline (piece-wise function).
 
   NO - no constraints for piece wise stations.
 
   YES <mm/yr> - applies constraints on the rate of change of positions
                 the stations whose position is modeled by linear spline.

allows Solve to invert normal matrix even if less than two good observations of
the source has been done (although the estimates themselves are senseless).
It is potentially dangerous options. Constraints should be loose enough,
otherwise they may bias the solution.

   Determines whether to impose constraints on source proper motions. This
allows Solve to invert normal matrix even if less than two good observations of
the source has been done (although the estimates themselves are senseless).
It is potentially dangerous options. Constraints should be loose enough,
otherwise they may bias the solution. NB: 1 mas/year = 1.5363D-16 rad/s.

   *{NO_NET_TRANSLATION  [NO or (YES {station_weight_file})]}
 
 
   Comment: this is an obsolete keyword. it is recommended to use
NO_NET_TRANSLATION_POSITION instead of NO_NET_TRASNLATION.
 
   This keyword allows user to impose weighted no-net-translation constraints
at station positions considered as LOCAL parameters constraints for each
session. (You should use NO_NET_TRANSLATION_POSITION if you are going to apply
constraints on station positions considered as GLOBAL parameters).
 
   NO  - not use
   YES - applies this constraints with station_weight_file.
   station_weight_file - file which contains relative weights of constraints.
                         If the qualifier is omitted then the file defined
                         in $MK5_ROOT/progs/solve/include/gsfcb.i in variable
                         STATION_WEIGHT_FILE
 
   Three equations of constraints are built: for X, Y, and Z coordinates of
station positions. Equations of constraints are the weighted sum of station
coordinates. These sums are constrained to zero. Sigma of the constraint
is defined in the constant LIN_STA__SIG__DEF .
 
    NB: if the file station_weight_file does not contain some stations,
solution may appear singular. As a rule of thumb station_weight_file should
contain ALL statations, although Solve doesn't have a mechanism to check it
and to warn a user.

   This keyword allows to impose no net rotation constraints applied to global
station velocity parameters. Horizontal projection of the vector of adjustment
of station velocity can be represented as a small rotation. The sum of all
these rotations is constrained to zero.
 
   Field 1 (what to do)
 
         NO - not to apply constraints.

   This keyword allows to impose no net rotation constraints applied to global
source position coordinates. A vector of adjustment of source coordinates can
be represented as a small rotation. The sum of all these rotations is
constrained to zero.
 
   Field 1 (what to do)
 
         NO - not to apply constraints.
 
         GLOBAL - in global mode, means to apply constraints on the sources

                  estimated as local parameters. In independent mode this
                  parameter means nothing.
 
         If both GLOBAL and LOCAL are omitted, then GLOBAL is used as default.
         It is recommended that at least one of the qualifiers should be used.

                         {[YES or NO] EXCEPT (source {source} ...\) ...} ) }
 
   This keyword allows to impose no net rotation constraints applied to
source proper motions. A vector of adjustment of source proper motions can
be represented as a small rotation. The sum of all these rotations is
constrained to zero.

                            ([YES SIGMA value])
                        ]
 
 
   the keyword STRUCTURE_ADMITTANCE determines the reciprocal weight of
constraints imposed on parameres for admittance of source structure
delay.
 
   NO  - no constraints to impose
 
 
   YES  SIGMA value - specifies the reciproical weight of the constraint
                      imposed on parameres for admittance of source structure
                      delay. The reciprocal weight is dimensionless.
 
        12 $SUPPRESSION
        ===============
 
 
   This section has two purposes. It suppresses specific global parameters.
It also imposes certain restrictions on the estimates BATCH produces.
For example, BATCH can produce identical velocity estimates for a group of
(closely located) stations.
 
NB: Special care should be taken when using options in $SUPPRESSION.
A user should understand very clear what he/she is going. BATCH checks only
syntax. It is very easy to get completely wrong results when suppression is
used incorrectly.
 
   The $FLAGS section must precede this section.
 
   NONE turns off both functions of this section.  To suppress global
parameters or restrict parameter estimation, the user must specify one or more
of the following options in any combination.  The VELOCITIES, STATIONS,
SOURCES, PROPER_MOTIONS, PRECESSION, RELATIVITY, and TIDES options suppress
parameters. The DIRECTION, RIGHT_ASCENSION, STATION_ORIGIN, VELOCITY_ORIGIN
and VELOCITY_TIE options restrict parameter estimation.
 
   Readers should keep in mind that in the $SUPPRESSION keywords that suppress
parameters, the syntax is the reverse of the syntax in the other control file
sections.  That is, in the rest of the control file, specifying things or
choosing YES turns things on, and not specifying them or choosing NO turns
things off. In this section, the opposite is true: YES means to suppress
parameter, NO -- not to suppress.
 
Example:
 
   RELATIVITY YES
   RELATIVITY NO
 
  RELATIVITY NO in the $FLAGS section and RELATIVITY YES in the $SUPPRESSION
section keep BATCH from estimating the parameter gamma Post-Newtonian theories
of gravitation. RELATIVITY YES in the $FLAGS section and RELATIVITY NO in the
$SUPPRESSION section estimate it.
 
                12.1 SUPPRESSION.VELOCITIES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {VELOCITIES      [YES or NO or sta_uen]
                    {EXCEPT (sta_uen {station} ...\) ...}}
 
 
   The VELOCITIES keyword suppresses station velocities. BATCH only suppresses
UEN velocities.
 
     Field 1 -
 
          YES - suppresses every component at every station.
 
          NO  - does not suppress any component at any station.
 
          sta_uen - suppresses specific components (at every station).
                    Its format is UEN, where '-'s (dashes) replace components
                    that should not be suppressed.
 
     Field 2 - suppresses alternate sets of velocity components at the listed
               stations. The specific components are determined by the sta_uen
               preceding each station. sta_uen must be specified as above.
 
   BATCH suppresses the velocities whether BATCH estimates them directly or
calculates them from an estimation of XYZ velocities.
 
                12.2 SUPPRESSION.STATIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {STATIONS        [YES or NO or sta_xyz ]
                    {EXCEPT (sta_xyz {station} ...\) ...}}
 
 
    The STATIONS keyword suppresses station positions. BATCH allows user
to suppress only XYZ positions.
 
    Field 1 -
 
          YES - suppresses every component at every station.
 
          NO - does not suppress any component at any station.
 
          sta_xyz - suppresses specific components (at every station).
                    Its format is XYZ, where '-'s (dashes) replace components
                    that should not be suppressed.
 
    Field 2 -
 
          Suppresses alternate sets of components at the listed stations.
          The specific components are determined by the sta_xyz preceding each
          station. sta_xyz must be specified as above.
 
                12.3 SUPPRESSION.RIGHT_ASCENSION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {RIGHT_ASCENSION [YES or NO] {EXCEPT {source ...\}}}
 
 
   Keyword RIGHT_ASCENSION forces to estimate the selected sources' right
ascensions so that if each source's estimate is weighted by the cosine of its
declination, the weighted estimates average to zero. This option eliminates
some degrees of freedom, preventing degenerate solutions.
 
   YES - imposes this restriction on all sources except those in the EXCEPT
         clause.
 
   NO - imposes this restriction on the sources in the EXCEPT clause.
 
   YES EXCLUDE - determines that sources except the ones listed in the clause
                 are participating in the equations of constraints.
 
   NO EXCLUDE  - determines that only the sources listed in the clause
                 are participating in the equations of constraints.
 
   (source {source}...\) - source list.
 
 
                12.4 SUPPRESSION.DECLINATION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {DECLINATION [YES or NO] {EXCEPT {source ...\}}}
 
 
   Keyword DECLINATION forces to estimate the selected sources' declination
so that the average of the estimates is zero. This option eliminates
some degrees of freedom preventing degenerate solutions.
 
   YES - imposes this restriction on all sources except those in the EXCEPT
         clause.
 
   NO - imposes this restriction on the sources in the EXCEPT clause.
 
   YES EXCLUDE - determines that sources except the ones listed in the clause
                 are participating in the equations of constraints.
 
   NO EXCLUDE  - determines that only the sources listed in the clause
                 are participating in the equations of constraints.
 
   (source {source}...\) - source list.
 
                12.5 SUPPRESSION.STATION_ORIGIN
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {STATION_ORIGIN  [YES or NO] {EXCEPT {station ...\}} }
 
 
   Keyword STATION_ORIGIN forces to estimates the selected stations' positions
so that their X (and Y and Z) component estimates average to zero. This
eliminates three degrees of freedom (the true averages), preventing degenerate
solutions.
 
   YES - imposes the restriction on all stations except those in the EXCEPT
         clause.
 
   NO  - doesn't imposes any restriction (unless EXCEPT clause. is specified)
 
   YES EXCEPT - imposes the restriction on all stations except those in the
                EXCEPT list
 
   NO EXCEPT - imposes the restriction on the stations in the EXCEPT list.
 
   station ...\ - station list
 
                12.6 SUPPRESSION.SOURCES
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SOURCES         [YES or NO or src_comp]
                    {EXCEPT (src_comp {source} ...\) ...}}
 
 
   The SOURCES keyword suppresses source coordinates.
 
   Field 1 -
 
           YES - suppresses every source's coordinates.
 
           NO - does not suppress any source's coordinates.
 
           src_comp - suppresses specific coordinates (for every source).
           Its format is RD, where '-'s (dashes) replace coordinates that
           should not be suppressed.
           RD    means to suppress both right ascension and declination;
           R-    means to suppress right ascension only;
           -D    means to suppress declination only;
           --    means to suppress nothing;
 
     Field 2 -
 
           Suppresses alternate sets of coordinates for the listed sources.
           The specific coordinates are determined by the src_comp preceding
           each source. Src_comp must be specified as in field 1.
 
Examples
 
     1) SOURCES YES EXCEPT -- 2345-167
 
     BATCH suppresses every right ascension and declination for every source
     except 2345-167. In other words, BATCH only estimates 2345-167's right
     ascension and declination.
 
     2) SOURCES NO EXCEPT R- 0048-097 -D 0106+013 2345-167
 
     BATCH suppresses three coordinates, 0048-097's right ascension
     and 0106+013 and 2345-167's declinations.  That is, BATCH
     estimates the right ascension and declination of every source,
     except 0048-097 (declination ascension only), 0106+013 (right ascension
     only) and 2345-167(right ascension only).
 
     SOURCES R- EXCEPT RD 2134+00 0048-097
 
     BATCH suppresses every source's right ascension and also
     suppresses 2134+00 and 0048-097's both right ascension and declinations.
     That is, BATCH estimates every declination except those of 2134+00 and
     0048-097.
 
                12.7 SUPPRESSION.PROPER_MOTIONS
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {PROPER_MOTIONS  [YES or NO or src_comp]
                    {EXCEPT (src_comp {source} ...\) ...}}
 
 
   The PROPER_MOTIONS keyword suppresses source proper motions.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - suppresses every source's proper motions.
 
           NO - does not suppress any source's proper motions.
 
           src_comp - suppresses specific proper motions (for every source).
                      Its format is RD, where '-'s (dashes) replace proper
                      motions that should not be suppressed.
           RD    means to suppress both right ascension and declination;
           R-    means to suppress right ascension only;
           -D    means to suppress declination only;
           --    means to suppress nothing;
 
     Field 2 -
 
           Suppresses alternate sets of proper motions for the listed sources.
           The specific proper motions are determined by the src_comp preceding
           each source. stc_comp must be specified as in field 1.
 
     The PROPER MOTIONS keyword is analogous to the SOURCES keyword, and users
should refer to that keyword's examples.
 
                12.8 SUPPRESSION.PRECESSION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {PRECESSION      [YES or NO]}
 
 
   YES - BATCH suppresses the estimate of the precession constant.
 
   NO -  BATCH does not suppress the estimate of the precession constant.
 
 
                12.9 SUPPRESSION.RELATIVITY
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {RELATIVITY      [YES or NO]}
 
 
   YES - BATCH suppresses the estimate of the Post-Newtonian parameter gamma.
 
   NO -  BATCH does not suppress the estimate of the Post-Newtonian parameter
         gamma.
 
 
                12.10 SUPPRESSION.DIRECTION
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {DIRECTION       [NO or (YES station_1 TO station_2)]}
 
 
   Keyword DIRECTION forces to estimate station 1's velocity in such a way that
the total azimuth vector from station_1 to station_2 keeps the same orientation
as the a priori vector. (BATCH permits the vectors' magnitudes to differ.)
In essence, this option constrains station 1 to move away from or towards
station 2, along the cord connecting them along the Earth's surface.
This eliminates degrees of freedom, producing a minimum constraint solution.
 
   Field 1 - specifies whether constraint on direction should be applied
 
           YES - to suppress
 
           NO  - not to suppress
 
   Field 2 - station_1
 
   Field 3 - TO
 
   Field 4 - station_2
 
                12.11 SUPPRESSION.VELOCITY_ORIGIN
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {VELOCITY_ORIGIN [YES or NO] {[HORIZ_ONLY or VERT_ONLY or BOTH or XYZ]}
                                {EXCEPT {station ...\}} }
 
 
   The keyword VELOCITY_ORIGIN impose constraints on velocity adjustments.
 
   Field 1 -
 
         NO - not to impose additional constraints
 
         YES - impose constraints.
 
   Field 2 -
 
          HORIZ_ONLY - Sum of horizontal components of all stations except
                       the stations listed in EXCEPT list is constrained
                       to zero.
 
          VERT_ONLY  - Sum of vertical components of all stations except
                       the stations listed in EXCEPT list is constrained
                       to zero.
 
          BOTH       - Sum of both horizontal and vertical components of all
                       stations except the stations listed in EXCEPT list is
                       constrained to zero.
 
          XYZ        - Sums of X-, Y- and Z- components of velocities of all
                       stations except the stations listed in EXCEPT list are
                       constrained to zero.
   Field 3 -
 
          EXCEPT     - specifies the list of stations which will not be
                       participating in suppression
 
   station ...\ - station list
 
 
                12.12 SUPPRESSION.VELOCITY_TIE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {VELOCITY_TIE    [NO  or (YES  (station_list ...\))
                            ({AND (station_list ...\)} ... ) }
 
 
   The keyword VELOCITY_TIE imposes strong constraints on the difference
between velocities of stations. As a result each group of stations listed
in VELOCITY_TIE will effectively have the same velocity.
 
   Field 1 -
           NO - not to impose velocity ties.
 
           YES - impose velocity tie on some stations
 
   Field 2 -
 
           station_list - list of station. The difference in velocities
                          of the the stations in this list is strongly
                          constrained to zero.
 
   The keyword VELOCITY_TIE allows to specify more than one list of tied
stations. The qualifier AND should be used as a delimiter of lists. If two
or more station lists are specified then velocities are tied within each
list, but the velocities of the stations from the different lists are not
tied.
 
   Examples:
 
1)  VELOCITY_TIE YES      DSS65    ROBLED32 MADRID64  \
                      AND SESHAN25 SHANGHAI           \
                      AND DSS15    GOLDMARS
    It means that a) three stations, DSS65 ROBLED32 MADTRID64, will
                     be analyzed in such a manner that the adjustments
                     of their velocity will be the same and
                  b) two stations: SESHAN25 and SHANGHAI will have
                     the same velocities and
                  c) two stations: DSS15 GOLDMARS will have the same
                     velocities
 
    NB: the same station cannot specified more than once! If you would like
    to tie velicities of three stations: A, B and C, then construction
 
           A B \
       AND A C
 
    will be illegal. Correct constuction is
 
       A B C
 
 
2)  VELOCITY_TIE NO
 
    It means that no constraints on difference in velocities will be imposed.
 
                12.13 SUPPRESSION.STATION_TIE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {STATION_TIE     [NO  or (YES  (station_list ...\})
                            ({AND (station_list ...\}) ... }
 
 
   The keyword STATION_TIE imposes strong constraints on the difference
between positions of stations. As a result each group of stations listed
in STATION_TIE will effectively have the same vector of coordinates.
 
   Field 1 -
           NO - not to impose station ties.
 
           YES - impose station tie on some stations
 
   Field 2 -
 
           station_list - list of station. The difference in position
                          of the the stations in this list is strongly
                          constrained to zero.
 
   The keyword STATION_TIE allows to specify more than one list of tied
stations. The qualifier AND should be used as a delimiter of lists.
If two or more station lists are specified then their positions are tied
within each list, but the coordinates of the stations from the different
lists are not tied.
 
   NB: the same station cannot specified more than once! If you would like
   to tie velicities of three stations: A, B and C, then construction
 
           A B \
       AND A C
 
   will be illegal. Correct constuction is
 
       A B C
 
        13 $ARCS
        ========
 
 
   The $ARCS section lists the session names which are to participate in the
solution. Suppression solutions do not process sessions, but must specify
a session in this section in order to activate the proper BATCH paths.
 
   The arc section may contain either the session list itself or the filename
which actually contains the list. The format of the station list in both
cases is the same.
 
   The arc-list consists of lines of variable length. Each line contains
the name of the session and, perhaps, some options or contains and * symbol
in he first field what is an indication that this line is a comment and
therefore is ignored by BATCH.
 
NB: An empty line means the end of the arc-list. Batch doesn't look at the
    contents of the arc-list which follow the empty line
 
                13.1 SUPPRESSION.SUPRESS_FILE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   {SUPPRESS_FILE [NONE or file_name]
 
 
  The SUPPRESS_FILE specifies the name of the so-called suppression file
or NONE if this function is not needed. SUPPRESS_FILE specifies the list
of parameters or their index which are to be suppressed. Lines which
starts from # are considered as comments and ignored. One record specifies
one suppressed parameter. It can be either in the form of a 20 characters
long internal SOLVE parameter name or in the form of a parameter index.
Solve first tries to interpret the record as a parameter index. If the
record is an integer in the range [1, n_par], where the n_par is the total
number of parameters in the solution, then the record is considered as
a parameter index. If Solve fails to interpret this number as a parameter
index, it tires to interpret it as as a parameter name. If it cannot find
parameter with such a name, it generates the error message and stops.
 
  If a solution runs in global mode, only global parameters can be suppressed.
If a solution runs in the independent mode, any parameter can be suppressed.
 
  It should be noted the SUPPRESS_FILE option should be used only as a last
resort for correcting errors in parameterization.
 
 
                13.2 ARCS.ARCFILE
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
   ARCFILE [NONE or file_name]
 
 
   The keyword ARCFILE in the $ARCS section specifies filename of the
arc-list. (Please, don't be confused with the keyword ARC_FILES in the
$SETUP section!)
 
   Field 1
 
         NONE - no arc-list is supplied the list of session follows
                the keyword at the next line.
 
         file_name - file name of the arc-list. If the filename is
                     specified then this line should be the last line
                     of the control file.

   The control file must list one line with the above format for each
session in the solution. Mandatory fields are the fields 1 and 2. Other fields
are optional. They changes settings of BATCH Solve for this session only.
NB: arc-line cannot exceed 256 characters and cannot be broken. If you need
to put a lot of options you may consider putting all or part of the options
in @include files. The total length of all include files should not exceed
8192 characters.
 
    Fields 1, 2 and 3 (repository dbname and ver) -- session identifier.
           These are mandatory fields
 
    repo   -- three charater long repository name. Repositories should be
              defined in the VLBI Catatalogue (VCAT) configuration file.
              Usually, vlbi catalogue repository name resides in
              $PSOLVE_SAVE_DIR/vcxat.conf directory. Usually OBS name
              is reserved for observed database and SIM for simulated
              datasets.
 
    dbname -- the name of the session, as recorded in the superfile catalog.
              Although may take any ascii characters, usually names abide
              YYYYMMDD_S or YYYYMMDD-S notation, where YYYY is year,
              MM -- integer month number, DD -- integer day number, S --
              low case letter suffix. Underscore in 9th position is used
              for observations, hyphen is for simulations.
 
    ver    -- the session's version number. Ver must be the exact version
              number. The user cannot specify zero for the last superfile
              version, as he/she can for database versions in various
              programs.
 
 
 
    ADDW   -- specifies the name of the file with additive weight
              corrections. These weight correctison are added in quadrature
              to observable uncertainties. The file has a header and data
              records, one record per observation. A line that starts
              with # beyond first three lines of the header is considered
              as a comment is bypassed by the parser. Format of the data

    ADDW_SCL -- not used
 
    AOC    -- specifies the name of the file with additive corrections
              to o-c (obsevatum minus caluculatum). The file has a header
              and data records, one record per observation. A line that starts

       AUTO -- uses the requested constraint for all stations of this
               session regardless of any constraints in the sessions'
               superfiles. The requested constraint must follow the
               qualifier AUTO and be given in picoseconds/hour.
 
       IN   -- uses the constraints sigmas kept in the session's superfile.
               If an session does not have constraints for a station, that
               station's atmosphere rates are unconstrained for that session.
 
       MOST -- uses the constraint sigma which is the maximum between the
               specified constraint and the constraint for that station
               saved in the superfile. By another words, the requested
               constraint sigma will be used unless a weaker (larger sigma)
               constraint sigma was saved in the superfile. The requested
               constraint must follow the qualifier MOST and be given
               in picoseconds/hour.
 
        NO  -- does not constrain any rate at any station for any session.
 
        YES -- the same as AUTO.
 
        constraint_in_ps/hour -- sigma of the constraint in psec/hr.

                regardless of what's in the session's superfile.
                The length of interval of spline in minutes should be
                specified after the qualifier INTERVAL.
 
        IN   -- for each session, uses the parameterization recorded in
                that session's superfile.
 
        MOST -- for each session performs a linear spline ( linear
                piecewise-continuous ) parameterization with the given
                interval at each station, unless the session's superfile
                contains a linear spline parameterization with a shorter
                interval. In that case, uses the parameterization saved
                in superfile. The length of interval of spline in minutes
                should be specified after the qualifier INTERVAL.
 
        NO   -- not to estimate atmosphere path delay in zenith direction.
 
        YES  -- the same as AUTO.
 
        INTERVAL -- the second qualifier. Indicates that the interval of
                    the spline should follow.
 
        interval_in_minutes -- specifies time span of the spline in minutes.
 
 
    ATMOSPHERE_OFFSET -- sets the flags indicating that only time
                         independent atmosphere zenith path delay for
                         the sites from the list should be estimated.
 
 
       nsites  -- the number of sites. If the number of sites is 1,
                  then and only then this counter can be omitted.
                  If the parser detects that the first parameter
                  after the keyword  ATMOSPHERE_OFF,  it considers
                  nsites=1 and treats the first parameter as the
                  name of the site.
 
       site1 sites ... -- list of sites. If a site has a blank inside the
                          name, that blank should be replace with the
                          underscore.
 
    ATM_OFF -- synonum of ATMOSPHERE_OFFSET
 
    ATMOSPHERE_EXCLUDE --  sets the flags indicating that atmospheric

                           gradients of the of the specified station(s)
                           should not be estimated. The list of stations
                           is preceded with the number of stations
                           in the list.
 
 
       nsites  -- the number of sites. If the number of sites is 1,
                  then and only then this counter can be omitted.
                  If the parser detects that the first parameter
                  after the keyword  ATMOSPHERE_OFF,  it considers
                  nsites=1 and treats the first parameter as the
                  name of the site.
 
       site1 sites ... -- list of sites. If a site has a blank inside the
                          name, that blank should be replace with the
                          underscore.
 
 
    BASDEP_CLO  -- sets estimation of the baseline-dependent clocks for

                   BASELINE_CLOCKS in the $FLAGS section.
 
        NO  -- not to estimate
 
        YES -- estimate. The list of baseline-dependent clocks is built
               by such a manner in order to estimate the maximal number
               of parameters which still guarantee the lack of singularity
               of the normal matrix.
 
        IN  -- estimate baselines dependent-clocks for those baselines
               which were selected in superfile.
 
 
    CLOCK_CONSTRAINTS -- sets flags which controls imposing

                         for all stations of this session.
 
       AUTO -- uses the requested constraint for all stations of this
               session regardless of any constraints in the sessions'
               superfiles. The requested constraint must follow the
               qualifier AUTO and be given in picoseconds/hour.
 
       IN   -- uses the constraints sigmas kept in the session's superfile.
               If an session does not have constraints for a station, that

    EQUAL_EFF_FREQ -- flag that requires the effective ionospheric frequency
                      should be the same. If set, the mean effective
                      ionospheric frequency is computed for all observations
                      of the experiment, and that frequency is used for
                      computation of ionospheric contribution for the single
                      band observation or the ionospheric-free linear
                      combination of dual-band observables.
 
                      The effective ionospheric frequency depends on IF
                      weights, and in general, differs from an observation
                      to observation within several pro cents. Therefore, Solve
                      supports observation-dependent effective ionospheric
                      frequencies, and the use of observation-dependent
                      effective ionospheric frequencies in most cases residual
                      residuals.
 
                      However, there are two cases when observation-dependent
                      effective ionospheric frequency can degrade, sometimes
                      significantly, the fit.
 
                      1) ionospheric frequencies can be wrong for some
                         observations due to bugs in visibility analysis.
 
                      2) group delays between low and high bands may have
                         a significant constant offset. This offset can be
                         due to different path delay in the signal chain or
                         due to ambiguity in phase calibration. When the
                         ionosphere-free path delay is computed, the
                         difference in group delays is multiplied by the
                         expression that depends on effective ionospheric
                         frequencies. If the effective ionospheric frequency
                         has a jitter due to differences in IF weights,
                         the constant difference is group delay will by
                         multiplied by this jitter which will be added to
                         o-c and will cause and additional noise.
 
                      In cases 1-2, setting EQUAL_EFF_FREQ improves results.
 
                      NB: Solve honors environment variable EQUAL_EFF_FREQ.
                      If it value is YES, then EQUAL_EFF_FREQ is applied to
                      all observing sessions.

              This weight file supersedes all other parameters and variables
