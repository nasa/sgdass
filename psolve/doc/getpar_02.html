Program getpar parses a spool file of the listing of Solve solution,
extracts information from there, formats it and writes down in the
set of output files.

  Usage: getpar &lt;spool_file&gt; &lt;prefix&gt;
 
where
  spool_file is the name of Solve spool file of global solution in
                either complete or back mode;
  prefix     is the main portion of the output filenames including path.
             The actual names of the output files are results of concatenation
             of prefix with extension.

   Each output file has first two lines comments. The comment lines contains
character # as the first character in the line. The first comment line,
and therefore the first line of the file always holds the name of the format,
its version and date of format revision:
 
# GETPAR_XXX format version 1.0  of 2001.05.25
 
  where XXX is (in capital letter) extension of the file, for example,
 
# GETPAR_STA format version 1.0  of 2001.05.25
 
  The second line, so-called header comment, contains the full path name of
the spool file. Since the format of getpar output files is the subject
of changes it is a good practice to check the format version each time when you
parse getpar output files.

   .sta file contains estimates of positions of global stations and the formal
uncertainties of these estimates. The list of station positions is sorted in
alphabetic order of station names. Stations before and after episodic motions
are treated as different stations. Correlations between station positions and
velocities are also written.
