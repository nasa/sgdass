         </LI>

   Before using GAMB check once more that calibration status for the
X-band and S-band databases is exactly the same. Then hit key <B>(A)</B> 
in order to initiate GAMB. In many cases it is enough for resolving 
ambiguities. In other cases GAMB issues you a warning. If GAMB doesn't issue
a warning you can be sure that ambiguities were resolved correctly. Warning 
usually means excessive noise or presence of observations with sub-ambiguities.
But GAMB may honestly confess that ambiguity resolution was unreliable or 
it may refuse to process the session at all.

  <H5> Troubleshooting </H5>

<UL>
     <LI> It may occur that there are baselines which have less than 8 used 
          observations. Ambiguity resolution becomes unstable for the baselines
          with few observations since GAMB uses statistical criteria. You can 
          try to reduce the limit of the number of observations, but you cannot
          set it less than 4. If the number of used observations at some
          baseline after GAMB processing becomes less than the limit, GAMB 
          suppresses all observations on that baseline and deselects that 
          baseline. As a rule of thumb it is not worth it to try to restore the 
          baseline with such a small number of observations. But if you find 
          that it is necessary to keep those observations you can restore that 
          baseline and then resolve ambiguities on that baseline manually.
          </LI><P>

     <LI> Group delay ambiguity spacings are different for different baselines.
          This situation may occur when some channels were dropped in fringing 
          due to hardware problems. GAMB refuses to process such an experiment. 
          There are two ways to overcome this problem. The easiest way is to
          reduce the group delay ambiguity spacing by dividing it by an integer
          number, e.g. 2. Be cautious! It is a dangerous option. An alternative
          way is to process the session in several steps:
          <P>
          <OL>
                <LI> Split baselines onto 2 (maybe more) sets with the same 
                     group delay ambiguities.
                     </LI><P>

                <LI> First deselect all baselines of the second set and leave 
                     the baselines of the first set only. The program SLVEB
                     does it. To call it hit <B>(B)</B> from the OPTIN menu.
                     Then use GAMB. GAMB will resolve ambiguities on the 
                     selected baselines and will not see deselected baselines 
                     and therefore will not complain.
                     </LI><P>

                <LI> Deselect all baselines of the first set and leave 
                     the baselines of the second set only. Then use GAMB
                     again. 
                     </LI><P>

                <LI> Then select all baselines, make a solution and check 
                     whether the permanent ambiguities at S-band and X-band 
                     remain. Since GAMB resolved ambiguities for several 
                     subnetworks independently, group delay closure may not 
                     be conserved for the baselines from different subnetworks. 
                     It is necessary to check first S-band, then the X-band 
                     and if the estimates of baseline clocks shows misclosure, 
                     then correct ambiguities.

<H4> Procedure for manual group delay ambiguity resolution suggested by A. Nothnagel
(for Fourfit genereated delays only) </H4>

  Manual group delay ambiguity resolution is an alternative technique. It is
rather more time consuming and it is recommended only if you failed to resolve 
ambiguities automatically.

<P>
<B><I> Steps of manual ambiguities resolution: </I></B>

<UL>
    <LI> Toggle the flag [Use normally (W)eighted delays] to [Down-(W)eighted
         delays by 1.D9] by hitting <B>(W)</B> in the last SETFL page. This 
         option reduces the weights of the delays by 1.D9 and forces the least 
         squares fit to get its deterministic only from the delay rates which 
         are not affected by the group delay ambiguities. However, the 
         residuals for the group delays are still calculated.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> By typing <B>(B)</B> we now enter the Baseline page where we select 
         the baselines of which data will be used in the least squares fit. 
         All baselines marked by the symbol 'X' will be used. You should 
         include only the independent baselines which are formed with the 
         reference station selected on the Site pages (for example, 
         WETTZELL-MATERA, WETTZELL/MEDICINA, WETTZELL/MATERA ...). All other 
         baselines should be excluded by hitting the space bar on the 
         respective line. 
         <B>NB:</B> There should be a good number of observations on each of 
         these baselines. If there are no observations (e.g. at the baseline 
         KOKEE/HARTRAO with length 98% of Earth's diameter) or only very few 
         on a baseline, you have to select another baseline which connects 
         the remote station to the reference station independently.
         </LI> <P>

    <LI> Make solution by hitting <B>(Q)</B>. 
         </LI> <P>

    <LI> When the adjustment is finished we can analyze the residuals by typing
         <B>(P)</B> on the OPTIN menu. In the case where there is only one 
         database loaded we see the list of baselines immediately, otherwise 
         we still have to select the database we want to examine before the 
         baselines to be plotted are displayed.
         <P>
 
         Start with the first of the baselines which contains the reference 
         station which you select from the list of baselines by moving the 
         cursor there and click in the left mouse button. When the plot of 
         residuals appears we may see several vertical lines with observations 
         separated by n * the ambiguity spacing which is indicated in the 
         second dialog window from the top (for example 50, 100 or 200 nsec, 
         this is the so-called ambiguity spacing). Move the mouse pointer onto 
         the dialog window field 'Shift All ambiguities', click the left mouse 
         button and move the cursor to the vertical line of residuals which is 
         closest to 0. Sometimes there may not even be any residuals at this 
         ambiguity level. The vertical position of the cursor does not matter, 
         only the horizontal. Press the left mouse button and all residuals are 
         shifted to that ambiguity level. Click 'CNPLT baseline page' and 
         select the next baseline containing the reference station. Repeat the
         ambiguity shifting for all baselines with the reference station and  
         run the solution again. Do not bother to look at the non-independent 
         baselines at this stage.
         </LI> <P>

    <LI> When all the independent baselines are fixed up have a look at the
         non-independent baselines with the plot routine as well and fix up any
         ambiguities. Here the residuals must now all be centered around zero! 
         There may, however, still be some drift in the residuals.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> If you think you have eliminated all ambiguities press <B>(Q)</B> 
         again to check. Look at the RMS delay residuals which should be below 
         10 ns at X-band and below about 30 ns at S-band. Repeat the plots and 
         check carefully. The next step is to go to the SETFL last page by
         hitting <B>(L)</B> from the main OPTIN menu and switching to 
         'Normally weighted delays' by hitting <B>(W)</B>. Repeat the least 
         squares fit and look at the residuals again. They should be much 
         smaller (< 2 - 3 nsec) now and any drifts in the residuals should 
         have vanished.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> Now we do the S-band with the same procedure as the X-band. For this 
         switch back to 'Down-weighted delays by 1.D9' in the SETFL last page, 
         then hit <B>(X)</B> on the OPTIN menu and set up the S band database 
         for the solution toggling the yes/no flags. Do not use both, 
         S and X band, in the fit simultaneously! When you want to plot 
         the residuals you have of course to look at the S-band data!
         <P>

         Hit <B>(X)</B> at the OPTIN menu and select the setup as follows:
         <P>
 
         Include in "Solution Generate residuals"

         <LISTING>
            X-band Yes Yes
            S-band No Yes
         </LISTING>

         In this setup the deterministic of the S-band residuals are not 
         determined by the S-band rates but by the X-band delays which have, 
         of course, to be free of any ambiguities.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> Type <B>(Q)</B> for making solution and examine the residuals of the 
         S-band database and shift ambiguities as you did with the X-band 
         data. For a test adjustment after you have shifted the S-band 
         ambiguities switch off the X-band database completely in the "X" 
         page. Do not use both S- and X-band in the fit simultaneously.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> After both databases have been corrected for ambiguities manually 
         you have to store the contribution to the group delay due to 
         ionosphere. This contribution is used for some solution types. 
         <B>NB:</B> you don't need to do it when you resolve ambiguities 
         automatically, since GAMB computes and stores the ionosphere 
         contribution for all observations.
         <P>

         To start the computation of S/X ionosphere contribution, return 
         to the main OPTIN page and invoke the program IONO by hitting 
         <B>([)</B>. The program lists the databases which reside in the 
         scratch files. We do not calibrate the S-band database. Normally 
         everything is set up properly and you just type <B>(P)</B>
         to continue.
         </LI><P>

    <LI> Set again databases status. Hit <B>(X)</B> in OPTIN menu. Set YES in 
         fields <TT>Include in solution?</TT>, <TT>Generate residuals?</TT> 
         for X-band databases and set NO for S-band database.
         </P>
</UL>

  <BIG><I> Group delay ambiguities are resolved. </I></BIG>
<P>

  The next step is to inspect residuals. Set estimation of baseline-dependent 
clocks: hit <B>(C)</B> from the menu of the last SETFL page. Menu of the 
program BCLOK will be displayed. First set all baselines by hitting <B>(W)</B>,
then deselect a clock reference station by hitting the station code.
<P>

  Make a solution by hitting <B>(Q)</B>. Look at the listing. Normally the 
total wrms should be in the range [500, 1500] psec. If it exceeds 2000 psec, 
it means that probably either ambiguity resolution was not successful or 
there are clock breaks at one or more stations.
<P>
  
  You should check estimates of baseline-dependent clocks. If the estimates 
exceed 1 nsec, it is an indication of remaining permanent ambiguities at
that baseline, i.e there are no jumps in ambiguities among observations at
all baselines but all observations at some baselines have incorrect 
ambiguities what causes triangle misclosures to be a multiple of the ambiguity 
spacing. You have to get rid of permanent ambiguities.
<P>

<A NAME="redistribution">
<H5> Manual re-distribution of permanent group delay ambiguities </H5>

  First you have to decide which band is affected by permanent ambiguities.
If baseline-dependent clocks has an adjustment by a multiple of the group delay 
ambiguity spacing at X-band -- then X-band. A permanent ambiguity at S-band
will contribute by <TT>f<SUB>X</SUB>/f<SUB>S</SUB> = 12 </TT> times less.
Thus, if you see baseline-dependent clock estimates less than one group delay
ambiguity spacing but still larger than 1 nsec, it is an indication that
there are S-band permanent ambiguities.
<P>

  Set solution type <TT><B>X-band only</B></TT> or <TT><B>S-band only</B></TT>
on the last SETFL page in accordance with the band affected by permanent 
ambiguities. Make a solution. Look at the list of baseline-dependent clocks.
Find the first baseline with the estimate of the baseline-dependent clocks
to be a multiple of group delay ambiguity spacing. Make plot of residuals of 
that baseline by hitting <B>(P)</B> at the OPTIN menu. Then use the function 
<TT>Set amb. shift</TT>. Set the correct sign of ambiguities: the sign should
be the same as the sign of the baseline-dependent clock adjustments if the 
order of stations in the baseline both in the listing and in CNPLT is the same.
The sign is opposite if the order of stations in  the listing and in CNPLT is 
different. Then use the function <TT>Shift multi pts</TT>. CNPLT will ask you 
to point to the <TT>Starting point</TT> and then the <TT>End point</TT>. Click 
at the point in the very bottom of the plot in order to mark the "Starting 
point", then click the point in the very top of the plot in order to mark the
"end point". Then you make a solution once more. Repeat this procedure if 
needed with the next baseline. Don't forget to set the solution type back to 
<TT>G-GXS combination</TT> after all these manipulations.
<P>

  Sometime you have observations with ambiguities less than the group delay 
ambiguity spacing. These are sub-ambiguities and they are caused by a wring 
choice of maximum in the delay resolution function.  There is no way to resolve 
sub-ambiguities in Solve. You have to suppress all observations with 
sub-ambiguities. It is still possible to recover at least part of such 
observations by running the program mk4fit for those observations, but this 
topic goes beyond this manual.
<P>

<H5> Inspection of residuals </H5>

  Now you have to inspect residuals baseline by baseline. The purpose is
to check quality of data, check whether the ambiguities were resolved correctly
and check whether clock breaks have to be inserted. Call program CNPLT
by hitting <B>(P)</B> from the OPTIN menu. (<B>NB:</B> CNPLT conflicts with 
some X-applications which grabs colors, like Netscape. You should close such
applications before running CNPLT.)
<P>

  If you find a jump in the plot of residuals you may try to insert a clock
break. Be sure that it is not a jump in ambiguities at X- or S-band. In order
to insert a clock break hit <B>(E)</B> in the main OPTIN menu, then 
list station's pages by hitting <B>(N)</B> or <B>(P)</B> till you find the 
station where you are going to insert clock breaks. Then hit <B>(*)</B> several 
times until you see a line <TT>insert</TT>. Then hit <B>(C)</B> and enter 
the time tag of the clock break. Then a new epoch for clock polynomial appears 
at the SETFL page for that station. Set the first three flags to 1 for the new 
clock break. Then make a new solution and check the listing and residual plots.
Keep in mind that there should be enough observations between the start of 
the session, clock break(s) and the end of the session. There should be no less 
than 4 observations, otherwise your solution will be unstable or singular. 
If it seems to you that the session has many clock breaks, it may indicate 
another serious problems unrelated to clock behavior.
<P>

  If you have a station with too few good observations (less than 5 at each
baseline), or you have a station with postfit residual scatter larger than 
5 nsec you can deselect it. But it is a last resort. In general you should try
to keep as many stations/baselines as possible in the initial and intermediary
solutions, and to leave the final decision to the time of the final solution.
An analyst is able to select/deselect station/baseline in any time during 
further solutions including batch runs, however the data should be edited 
properly, otherwise selecting the baselines which have been suppressed during
the initial solution might degrade the solution due to the presence of 
outliers.
