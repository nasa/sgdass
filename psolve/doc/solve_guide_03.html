    The SOLUTION keyword specifies the solution's type.
 
    COMPLETE    - performs complete combined global solution. At least one
                  parameter is treated as global parameter and estimated over
                  all observations and at least one parameter is treated as a
                  local parameter and estimated for each session independently.
 
    FORWARD     - Performs only the first step of the global solution. CGM is
                  created but not inverted at the end of this run.
 
    GLOBAL_ONLY - Performs the first step of global solution, creates CGM,
                  inverts it, obtains global parameters adjustment, computes
                  some statistics and quits without computing adjustment to
                  local parameters.
 
    BACK        - Performs only the second step of the global solution.
                  Required the input CGM which hold intermediary results of
                  the forward step of the global solution. Solve first inverts
                  CGM, finds estimates of the global parameters and their
                  formal uncertainties, then consecutively finds the estimates
                  of the local parameters and their formal uncertainties.
                  Finally, statistics of the solution are computed.
 
    INDEPENDENT - Solve analyzes each session in the arc-list specified in the
                  section $ARCS independently. It means that all parameters
                  are estimated using the observations of one session only.
 
    SUPPRESSION - removes suppressed global parameters from a CGM
                  so that two programs not related to BATCH can use it.
                  Rarely used mode.
 
    *SUBTRACT:  - modifies CGM for taking out contributions of some sessions
                  from an existing CGM.

               NONE - no CGM used.
 
               input_name - full path to the input CGM.
 
     Field 2 - names the output CGM, if the solution produces one: COMPLETE
               or FORWARD or SUPPRESSION solution type. The output CGM is
               ignored if the solution is not producing the CGM. If the
               solution produces a CGM, but the name of the output CGM is
               not specified, then BATCH will name the CGM according to rules
               given below.
 
     output_name omitted - names the output CGM C#####.#####, where each
                           pair of numbers represents the year, month, day,
                           hour, minute and second of the solution, in that
                           order in UTC timescale.
 
     output_name specified - names the output CGM output_name. output_name
                             should not include a path, because BATCH
                             automatically decides where to place the CGM,
                             as described below. The user should make sure that

                             If it does, BATCH will stop before processing the
                             first superfile.
 
     If the output CGM is specified without path name then BATCH puts output
     CGM in the following directories and catalogs:
 
     Test solution:      catalog:   TSTCAT on SCRATCH_DIR
                         directory: $SCRATCH_DIR/

   Determines whether the run produces/uses arc_files, and, if so, where to
store/search for them. Arc_file is a file with intermediary results produced
by Solve in the forward step and used in the backward step.
 
     Field 1 - Ordinarily back steps purge arc files as soon as they've used
               them. This field saves the files for future solutions.
 
     Field 2 - Determines whether BATCH produces/uses arc files, and, if so,
               where to store/search for them.
 
           0 - Prevents forward steps from producing arc_files. Tells back
               steps to create arc_file information. In this case back will
               repeat the work which forward step has done but did not store.
 
               Up to three paths can be specified. BATCH creates (forward step)
               or looks for (back step) arc files on these directories. BATCH
               creates/looks for session n in the $ARCS section as [####XX,
               where #### is n specified as four digits and XX is the run's
               initials. Leading zero(es) will be added if necessary in order
               to fit 4 digit format.
 
               NB: "n" (the number of the session in the arc-list) is computed
               according to the line number in the control file. If any line
               is removed or added then SOLVE cannot restore run correctly.
 
   In the forward step, BATCH starts with the first path and works its way
through the list as each path fills. Once BATCH goes to a new path, it does not
go back to see if space has been restored to previous paths, unless the user
restarts BATCH. Before creation of an arc_file BATCH checks disk space. It
considers the disk as full if it has less than 64 Mb free space. Once it runs
through the list, BATCH stops silently making arc files.
 
   Arc files take up a lot of space, so the users at an installation should
agree on the directories where the files should be created. Disk for arc_files
should be a fast disk. DON'T ASSIGN A REMOTE DISK as an arc-dir disk!
 
   If a back step cannot find an arc file, there is usually no problem, since
back steps can make the information on the fly, however, it would take
additional CPU time.

</B></FONT>
 
   The keyword TRAIN specifies the mode in which Solve should run.
 
   TRAIN YES - forces Solve to call a chain (train) of executables for
               processing the job. It is not recommended to use this since
               Solve runs much slower than in NO TRAIN mode.
 
   TRAIN NO  - means that only one executable: BATCH will do entire work.
               It calls other modules as subroutines.
 
   NO TRAIN mode can be used for COMPLETE, FORWARD, BACK and INDEPENDENT
            types of solutions.
 
   Qualifier GLO_PARLIM specifies an expected number of global parameters. It
   should not exceed the maximal number of parameters specified by solve_reset
   and should not be less than parameter GLO_PARLIM__LIM specified in
   ../include/glbc4.i (current value: 256). BATCH grabs dynamic memory from
   the very beginning and it should know the maximal size of CGM. What will
   occur if the actual number of global parameters turns out greater than
   GLO_PARLIM? In the case BATCH will save CGM, free dynamic memory, increase
   the limit of expected parameters by INC_PARLIM (but not more than the
   maximal number of parameters for the set of scratch files, specified by
   solve_reset!), grab dynamic memory once more, restore CGM and continue
   computation. INC_PARLIM specifies the increment of the parameters limit.
 
   Example:
 
   If a user makes a global solution and expects the number of global
   parameters will be about 1280 then a good choice is
 
     TRAIN NO GLO_PARAM 1280 INC_PARLIM 128
 
   NB: If the actual number of parameters turns out exceeding the limit
specified by solve_reset in making scratch files then Solve will treat this
situation as a fatal error.

   Each time BATCH processes an session, it reads it into the run's obsfil and

analysis on the arc. USER_PROGRAM specifies the name of the program which
runs after reading obsfil but before processing the first observation.
USER_PROGRAM is used for adding user calibration to obsfil. User program can
also write down a file with user constraints to be imposed on local parameters.
File with constraints should has a name $WORK_DIR/ULC{solve_initials} .

                name is recommended.

                  is less than 80 than trailing blanks will added.
                  User program should read this string using pipe.
 
Comments:
 
  1) If the field 2 is supplied, then the user program **MUST ALWAYS**
     read 80 bytes from the pipe. For example it should have a statment like
 
          CALL USE_BUFFER ( %REF(STRING), INT2(40), 'ORC' )
 
     Failure to execute this statment in user program will result in
     overflowing the pipe. When the pipe is overflown, Solve "hangs":
     it waits indefinitely for reducing the size of message in the pipe.
 
  2) If the field 2 is not supplied then user program SHOULD NOT attempt
     to read from the pipe.
 
  3) Character "\" cannot be used as a delimeter in USER_BUFFER.

   This keyword determines whether BATCH
a) should use corrections to weights from the external file, and if yes which
   type corrections: by baseline, by site, by session;
b) should generate the external files of corrections to weights.
 
   weighs of observable are computed as
 
   weight = 1/dsqrt ( sig_snr**2 + corr**2 )
 
   here sig_snr -- formal uncertainty computed on the basis of SNR,
        corr -- correction to weights. It may be baseline-dependent,
        site-dependent or session-dependent.
 
   If a keyword WEIGHTS is not specified then weights saved in superfile will
   be in use.
 
   NO - means no corrections to weights will applied, and the corrections to
        the weights kept in the superfiles will be discarded.
 
   IN - means that corrections to weights kept in the superfiles should be
        applied.
 
   MAKE and APPEND - generate corrections to weights for every session in the
        solution and place them in output weight_file. (MAKE creates the new
        file, and APPEND appends to an existing file.)
 
   USE  and REQUIRE - attempt to use weight_file for every session in
        the solution.  If weight_file does not contain a session, USE
        uses the weighting scheme recorded in the session's superfile, and
        REQUIRE aborts.
 
   #NUM -- the number of weight files in the range 1 to 4. If only one weight
           file is used, this parameter can be omitted.
 
   weight_file -- a full path to the file with additive re-weighting
                  parameters.
 
   BY_BASELINE together with MAKE and REQUIRE means that baseline-dependent
           correction to weights should be generated. Ignored if USE of
           REQUIRE qualifiers were specified, since the type of corrections to
           the weights is determined by file file format.
 
   BY_SITE together with MAKE and REQUIRE means that station-dependent
           correction to weights should be generated. Ignored if USE of
           REQUIRE qualifiers were specified.
 
   BY_ARC  together with MAKE and REQUIRE means that session-dependent
           correction to weights should be generated. Ignored if USE of

   DEFAULT (or keyword omitted) - weights by baseline. It is strongly

             ELIM  - weights, outliers elimiation and resurrection of
                     previously suppressed observations is computed by
                     the ELIM algorithym developed by Leonid Petrov.
                     The name of the PARU control file should be specified

   BATCH produces corrections to weights which match the data type selected for
the session through the $SESSIONS section or the $DATA sections TYPE keyword.
BATCH writes each session's weights to a separate line, along with the
session's key name and version. Weight files are in ASCII format. Weights file
has different formats for baseline-dependent corrections, site-dependent
corrections, session-dependent corrections.
 
    Only independent solutions can create or update weight files.

   The keyword ELEVATION_DEPENDENT_NOISE allows user to make
correction to weights according to their elevation angles. The new
weight ata baseline {ij} is expressed throuth the old weight signa_in as
 
sigma_out_ij = sqrt ( sigma_in_ij**2 + (R_i*M(e_i))**2 + (R_j*M(e_i))**2 )
 
where R_k is the parameter from the table below for the k-th station,
e_k is the elevation at the k-th station, and M(e) is the mapping function.
Two formats are supported: pre-JAN2000 and POST-DEC2007.
The pre-JAN2000 format uses these qualifiers:
 
 
      Field 1 -

  Format specifications of the ELDEP format of 2007.12.03
 
 
The file in ELDEP format specifies reweighting parameters that
are elevation-dependent and station dependent
 
The used reciprocal weights at the baseline ij is computed as
 
sigma_out_ij = sqrt ( sigma_in**2 + (R_i*M(e_i))**2 + (R_j*M(e_i))**2 )
 
where R_k is the additive parameter from the table below for the
k-th station, e_k is the elevation at the k-th station, and M(e)
is the mapping function of elevation that is the ration of the
slanted path delay at elevation e to the path delay in the zenith
direction.
 
Format:
 
The file in ELDEP format consists of records in ASCII coding.
The first records identifies the format revision date
Records that starts from character # are considered as comments
Date records have the following format:
 
Field   1:8   A8
Field  11:24  D14.8  Additive reweighting parameter to delay in seconds
Field  27:40  D14.8  Additive reweighting parameter to delay rate in s/s
 
  An alternative way to specity the elevation dependent noise variance is
to use MULTI_GLOB keyword
 
  Keyword:
 
  MULTI_GLOB  {value}  -- sets the variance of the elevation depended
                          noise proportional to the slanted
                          un-hydrostactic path delay. The value specifies
                          the coefficent of this proportionality.

   BATCH Solve supports several algorithms of solving LSQ problem. The keyword
FAST_MODE sets the algorithm.
 
   NONE  - in INDEPENDENT mode means to use strait-forward algorithm;
           in COMPLETE, FORWARD, BACK solution types means to use B1D algorithm
           (arc parameters elimination).
 
   B3D   - in INDEPENDENT solution type means to use B3D algorithm
           (recommended way). B3D mode is not supported in COMPLETE, FORWARD
           and BACK solution types.
 
   B1B3D - in in COMPLETE, FORWARD, BACK solution types means to use B1B3D
           algorithm (recommended way). B1B3D is not supported in INDEPENDENT
           solution types.
 
   B3D and B1B3D algorithms are mathematically equivalent to the direct
strait-forward methods of solving LSQ problems but they are much faster.
In practice they give slightly different results since rounding errors are
accumulated by the different way. However, the difference in the estimates
usually are very small: less than 0.0001 sigma and does not exceed 0.1 sigma
even for the worst case of unstable parameterization.
 
   B3D and B1B3D together are called "fast mode" while NONE is called slow
mode. Solve runs faster by the factor 1.5-20 in fast mode.

CGM after processing each &lt;rate&gt; sessions where &lt;rate&gt; is an integer value.
SAVING_RATE affects only forward step of global solution. Recovery of the
interrupted BATCH solution is possible only after saving the intermediary CGM.
For example if saving rate is 100 and solution was interrupted during
processing the 188-th session, a Solve run in recovery mode would start from
the 101-th session. Thus, the larger value &lt;rate&gt;, the more unnecessary work
will be done in recovery of the solution. The smaller value &lt;rate&gt;, the slower
Solve is running since writing intermediary CGM takes considerable time.
Recommended value is 128 for normal runs.

              $-character removed. The ascii decimation file has five header
              lines and NOBS observations record, where NOBS is the number of
              observations. An observation record has fields observation index,
              scan index, station names, source name, suppression status
              and decimation status. Solve writes in the observation the
              suppression status of each observation and an initial decimation
              status 0 for suppressed observations and 1 for used observations.
 
              The third value, ASCII or BINARY, specifies in which format
              the decimation file is to be created. Files in ascii format
              have extension .eda, files in binary format have extension
              .edb .
 
   REQUIRE -- requires to use decimation status recorded in decimation files.
              Solve searches for a file with name in the directory specified
              in the second value of the keyword with name {exp}.edc
              if does not exist, with name {exp}.eda, where {exp} is the
              database name with leading $-character removed. If it does not
              find decimation file, Solve writes the error message and
              stops. Solve examines the header of the file. If the header
              has different number of stations, sources, scans etc than the
              database, Solve writes the error message and stops. Solve
              examines each observation record. If the field decimation
              status is the same as the third argument param, Solve uses
              this observation, otherwise the observations is discarded.
              If param is zero or positive and the observations is
              suppressed, Solve does not use this observation. If param is
              negative, and decimation status is the same as param, Solve
              uses the observation regardless, whether it was previously
              suppressed or not.
 
   USE     -- the same as require, but if the decimation file does not
              exist or has wrong format, or wrong header, Solve prints
              a warning and ignores decimation.
 
   Solve supports two formats for external decimation files: binary and
   ascii. An external decimation file in binary format has extension .edb,
   and an external decimation file in binary format has extension .eda.
   Solve first searches for a binary file with extension .edb . It if
   does not find, it searchs for an ascii file with extension .eda .
   If there exist two files,with estension .edb and with extension .eda ,
   the file with extension .eda is ignored.
 
   Binary files should be used. Usage of ascii files involves siginificant
   overheads and desigined primarily for testing.

   The SOURCES keyword determines whether BATCH estimates source coordinates.
Fields 1-3 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all sources. Field 4
adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for the specific
sources. This includes either lifting the flag to estimate right ascension
for the reference source or specifying exception list. The estimation flag is
reversed for the specified components of the objects in the exception list.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - to estimates coordinates of all source.
 
           NO  - does not estimate any source's coordinates.
 
           IN  - keep estimation flags set in the database in interactive
                 solution and saved in the superfile.
 
     Field 2 - Epoch too which the estimates are to be referred. In the case
               if no proper motion is estimated this qualifier is ignored.
               If proper motion is estimated, then source coordinates are
               modeled as "prop_motopm*(t - t0) + coord". So, the field 2
               specified this epoch t0 in TDB scale. The value of the
               qualifier is in the format YYYY.DD.MM-hh:mm:ss . Only YYYY
               potion is mandatory. Other fields of the epoch, if omitted,
               are filled by xxxx.01.01-00:00:00 . Example of valid epochs:
               2000, 1997.01.01, 2002.12.27_08:40:49 . If the qualifier
               REF_EPOCH and its value are omitted then Solve sets default
               date 2000.01.01_12:00:00 . This default is for compatibility
               with early version of Solve only. It is recommended that the
               qualifier REF_EPOCH should **always** be specified in global
               solutions when source coordinates and proper motions are
               estimated.
 
     Field 3 - a global source component. Field 1 is applied only for the
               component specified in field 2. If omitted then RD
               (right ascension and declination) is assumed.
 
     Field 4 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified
               in the fields 1-2. If field 3 is omitted then the previous
               qualifiers are applied to "All sources".
 
           ref_source -- selects the reference source, the source whose
                         right ascension is not estimated. This flag for
                         estimation of source's declination is not changed.
                         If an session does not contain ref_source,
                         BATCH aborts.
 
           PICK - uses the first source in every session as the reference
                  source.
 
           EXCEPT  -- exception list. Each element if this list is the source
                      name which can be preceded by the sub-field source
                      components. If the sub-field source component is omitted
                      than "RD" is assumed. Estimation flag for the specified
                      coordinate component of the specified source is toggled:
                      if global definition defined YES (to estimate this
                      component for this source), then this flag is reversed
                      (NOT to estimate) and vice versus.
 
 
           src_comp -- one of "RD", "R-", "-D", "--" where
                       R  --  stands for right ascension,
                       D  --  stands for declination,
                       -  --  stands for an unwanted component.
 
  How does it work.
 
a) Initialization.
 
   If field 1 is IN then source estimation status saved in the
   database/superfile is kept. Otherwise estimation flag is set to the status
   "not to estimate any source coordinate".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If source component is omitted, estimation flag is set for both right
   ascension and declination. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
   If the reference source was specified explicitly or implicitly (PICK) then
   the right ascension estimation flag of this source is lifted.
 
   For each source found in exception list, for each specified component of
   such a source the estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
  Comment: if not all two components of source coordinates were estimated,
           the NO-NET rotation constraints cannot be applied to such a source.
 
   Example:
 
1)   SOURCES   YES  REF_EPOCH 1997.01.01 EXCEPT 3C345
 
       Estimate right ascensions and declination for all sources, except 3C345.
 
1)   SOURCES   YES  REF_EPOCH 1996.01.01 -D
 
       Estimate right declination for all sources.
 
3)   SOURCES   NO  EXCEPT 3C345
 
       Estimate right ascensions and declination of 3C345 only.
 
4)   SOURCES   NO  R- EXCEPT 3C345
 
       Estimate right ascensions and declination of 3C345 only.
 
 
5)   SOURCE NO REF_EPOCH 1994.07.01 RD EXCEPT R- NGC5141 2134+00 -D 3C345
 
       Estimation right ascension of NGC5141, right ascension and declination
       of 2134+00, declination of 3C345
 
6)   SOURCE YES  REF_EPOCH 2000.01.01_12:00:00
 
       Estimate coordinates of all sources.

   The STATIONS keyword determines whether BATCH estimates station positions.
Fields 1-2 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all stations. Field 4
adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for the specific
stations. This includes either lifting the flag to estimate station position
for the reference station or specifying exception list. The estimation flag is
reversed for the specified components of the objects in the exception list.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - to estimates station positions.
 
           NO  - does not estimate any station positions.
 
     Field 2 - Epoch too which the estimates are to be referred. In the case
               if no velocity is estimated this qualifier is ignored.
               If velocity is estimated, then position is modeled as
               "vel*(t - t0) + pos". So, the field 2 specified this epoch
               t0 in TDB scale. The value of the qualifier is in the format
               YYYY.DD.MM-hh:mm:ss . Only YYYY potion is mandatory. Other
               fields of the epoch, if omitted, are filled by
               xxxx.01.01-00:00:00 . Example of valid epochs: 2000,
               1997.01.01, 2002.12.27_08:40:49 . If the qualifier REF_EPOCH
               and its value are omitted then Solve sets default date
               1980.10.17_00:00:00 (This is the date of the best experiment
               of Merit program). This default is for compatibility with
               early version of Solve only. It is recommended that the
               qualifier REF_EPOCH should **always** be specified in global
               solutions when station positions and velocities are estimated.
 
     Field 3 - a global station component. Field 1 is applied only for the
               component specified in field 2. If omitted then XYZ
               (three Cartesian components in the crust-fixed reference system)
               is assumed.
 
     Field 4 (D) - (rarely used -- most users omit this field)
 
         field omitted - the components described below are not estimated.
 
         D - estimates the diurnal radial station component by session at every
             station. This field was implemented because nutation mimics
             diurnal station motion, and this field can show how much the
             station vertical affects nutation. BATCH performs this estimate
             by fitting a sine to the station vertical.
 
 
     Field 5 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified
               in the fields 1-2. If field 3 is omitted then the previous
               qualifiers are applied to "All stations".
 
         PICK - BATCH chooses the reference station for each session. BATCH
                refers to a list of reference stations, using the first station
                that is in the session. If none are, BATCH uses the first
                station it finds in the session. The list is located in the
                file $SAVE_DIR/STATION_PICK
                Estimation flag for all components of the reference station
                is set to "NO".
 
         ref_station - BATCH tries to use this station for every session.
                       If any session does not have the station, BATCH aborts
                       at the end of that session. Estimation flag for all
                       components of the reference station is set to "NO".
 
 
         EXCEPT  -- exception list. Each element if this list is the station
                    name which can be preceded by the sub-field station
                    components. If the sub-field station component is omitted
                    than "XYZ" is assumed. Estimation flag for the specified
                    coordinate component of the specified station is toggled:
                    if global definition defined YES (to estimate this

                       -  --  stands for an unwanted component.
 
  How does it work.
 
a) Initialization.
 
   Estimation flag is set to the status "not to estimate any station position".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If the station component is omitted, estimation flag is set for all three
   components in XYZ system. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
   If the reference station was specified explicitly or implicitly (PICK) then
   the estimation flag for the reference station is lifted.
 
   For each station found in the exception list, for each specified component
   of such a station the estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
  Restriction: XYZ and UEN components should not be mixed. You cannot estimate
  XYZ components for one station and UEN component for another station.
 
 
   Example:
 
1)   STATIONS YES  REF_EPOCH 1997.01.01
 
       Estimate XYZ coordinates of all stations
 
2)   STATIONS YES REF_EPOCH 1996.07.01  UEN EXCEPT U-- GIFU3  U-- CRIMEA
 
       Estimate Up, East North components for all stations, but to estimate
       only horizontal coordinates for stations GIFU3 and CRIMEA
 
  Comment: if not all three components of station position were estimated,
           the NO-NET trasnaltion and rotation constraints cannot be applied
           to such a station.
 
   NB: The STATIONS keyword must always precede the VELOCITIES keyword.

   The VELOCITIES keyword determines whether BATCH estimates station velocities.
Fields 1-2 sets estimation flags globally, i.e. for all stations. Field 3
adjusts the estimation flags which have been already set for the specific
stations. It defines exception list which consists of station name
and optionally station components. Estimation flag is reversed for the
specified components of the objects in the exception list.

               (three Cartesian components in the crust-fixed reference system)
               is assumed.
 
     Field 3 - defines the rules which overrides global definitions specified
               in the fields 1-2. If field 3 is omitted then the previous

   Estimation flag is set to the status "not to estimate any station velocity".
 
b) Global setting.
 
   If Field 1 is YES, then estimation flag is set for the specified components.
   If the station component is omitted, estimation flag is set for all three
   components in XYZ system. If Field 1 is NO, then this step is skipped.
 
c) Adjustment.
 
 
   For each station found in the exception list, for each specified component
   of such a station the velocity estimation flag is toggled: if it was "YES",
   it is set to "NO", if it was before "NO" it is set to "YES".
 
 
Examples:
 
 
  1) VELOCITIES YES EXCEPT XY- GILCREEK HRAS_085

       and HRAS 085, where only X and Y are estimated.
 
  2) VELOCITIES NO UEN EXCEPT -EN GILCREEK
 
       Only the East and North velocities at GILCREEK are estimated.
 
  3) VELOCITIES YES X-- EXCEPT -YZ WESTFORD HRAS_085 XYZ GILCREEK
 
       At GILCREEK and HRAS 085, estimates Y and Z. No velocity component is

  The HARMONIC_POS keywords specifies the harmonics (name, phase,
frequency), the list of station(s) for which harmonic variations
of coordinates are adjusted and the reciprocal weights of
no-net-rotation and no-net-translation constraints. More than one
harmonic can be specified. Each harmonic may have its own station list.
Contents of this keyword or any part of it may be specified in the
external file. Solve will read the file name specified with the prefix
@ and add its content to the batch control file for parsing. Six
parameters are adjusted for each harmonic and for each station from
the station list: the amplitude of sin ( phase + freq*t ) for X, Y,
and Z components, and the amplitude of cos ( phase + freq*t )
for X, Y, and Z components.
 
  In general, if harmonic variations were estimated for all sites, the
LSQ problem has rank deficiency 6*N_HAR, where N_HAR is the number of
harmonics. In order to overcome the rank deficiency, no-net-translation
and no-net-rotation constraints are to be imposed.
 
  Care should be taken in designing the list of stations for harmonic
site position variations estimation. A station with poor observation
history may not have enough observations for reliable estimation of
harmonic site position amplitudes and for its separation from global
site position, global velocity, and possibly coefficients of B-spline
estimates. For example, if a station observed only during several
occupations it is unlikely that its harmonic position variations at
annual frequency can be adjusted. A poor history of observations of
even one site may cause a failure of the global matrix inversion.
 
            NAME -- Unique name of the harmonic with 1-8 characters.
 
         STATION -- List of stations which participated in estimation of
                    position variations for this harmonic. Blanks insides

  Keyword  SPLINE_POS  determines the parameterization for estimation
of coefficients of expansion with the B-spline basis of positions
displacements of one or more sites. For each station the degree of
the basis, the time epoch of modes, the multiplicity of each nodes and
the reciprocal weights of constraints are specified. Either entire
specification of the keyword or any portion of specifications can be
put in an external file and the name of this file can be used as an
option with preceding @ character. Solve will read this @-file, and
puts its contents to the batch file (without modifying original batch
file) and parse its contents.
 
  NB: The multiplicity of the first and node should be equal to
spline degree. The multiplicity of the last node should be zero.
 
  If global site position is estimated, the global normal matrix has
rank deficiency 3. In order to reduce rank deficiency, de-mean
constraint can be imposed which requires the integral of the B-spline
over the interval from the first to the last node be equal to zero.
 
  If global site velocity is estimated, the global normal matrix has
rank deficiency 3. In order to reduce rank deficiency, de-trend
constraint can be imposed which requires the first moment of the B-spline
over the interval from the first to the last node be equal to zero.
 
  Care should be taken in designing the list of stations for non-linear
site position variations estimation. A station with poor observation
history may not have enough observation for reliable estimation of
harmonic site positions and for its separation from global site position,
global velocity and coefficients of B-spline estimates. A poor history
of observations of even one site may cause a failure of the global matrix

   The CLOCKS keyword determines how the clock parameters are estimated.
Two formats are supported: the current and the obsolete marked by *. The
obsolete format is maintained only for providing backward compatibility and it
is not recommended to use it.
 
   Clocks in general are modeled by a sum of a local polynomial of the 1-st
or 2-nd degree plus linear spline with intervals of equal spans (linear spline
can be omitted). The local polynomial is estimated using all observations at
this station in the session. If the session has N clock breaks then N local
polynomials are estimated. Clock polynomials has discontinuities at the epochs
of clock breaks.
 
Current format:
---------------
 
     MAX_DEGREE - specifies the order of the local polynomial of clock function.
 
           IN   - take the same order as it saved in the database.
           AUTO - set order of the polynomial regardless the value saved in the
                  superfile.
           MOST - set order of the polynomial which is maximal between the
                  specified one conserved in the database.
                  1 -- polynomial of the first order will be used.
                  2 -- polynomial of the second order will be used.
 
     INTERVALS  - specifies length of span of linear spline.
 
        IN - the length of linear spline is taken from superfile.
 
        NO - no linear spline is estimated
 
     FORCE - uses a linear spline parameterization for every station in every
             session, with the requested interval in minutes. Totally
             overrides the parameterization in the sessions' superfiles,
             INCLUDING CLOCK BREAKS. Provided for backward compatibility only.
             Not recommended to use.
 
     AUTO - uses a linear spline parameterization for every station in every
            session, with the requested interval in minutes. Ignores the
            parameterization in the superfiles, except for preserving all
            clock breaks.
 
     MOST - for each session, performs a linear spline parameterization with
            the given interval at each station, unless the session's superfile
            contains a linear piecewise-continuous parameterization with
            a shorter interval. Then BATCH uses that interval. Preserves
            clock breaks. The interval must be in minutes.

               for every station in every session, with the requested interval
               in minutes. Totally overrides the parameterization in the
               sessions' superfiles, including clock breaks.
 
     PICK    - uses a linear piecewise-continuous parameterization for
               every station in every session, with the requested interval in
               minutes. Ignores the parameterization in the superfiles, except
               for preserving clock breaks inserted with Solve's interactive
               automatic constraint feature.
 
     MOST    - for each session, performs a linear piecewise-continuous
               parameterization with the given interval at each station,
               unless the session's superfile contains a linear
               piecewise-continuous parameterization with a shorter interval.

   The UT1/PM keyword determines how BATCH estimates UT1 and polar motion
(X- and Y-wobble). UT1 and polar motion are collectively called earth
orientation. UT1/PM has two syntax format: the current ad the obsolete. The

                                          specified as 17:00:00, then the EOP

       over all observations of the session. Constraints on the rate of change
       between adjacent nodes 5.0 mas and 0.33 msec/day are imposed.
 
    3) UT1/PM NO means not to estimate UT1 at all.
 
 
Obsolete format:
----------------
 
     Field 1 (the first five lines) -  determines how BATCH
     estimates UT1 and polar motion.
 
          NO - does not estimate UT1 or polar motion.
 
          YES - estimates one offset apiece for X-wobble, Y-wobble
                and UT1. BATCH estimates each offset at the first 0000 UTC
                epoch in the session.
 
          Other parameterizations - must be set as follows:
 
               The user must specify separate choices for polar
               motion (WOBBLE) and UT1. There are three categories
               of choices:
 
               1. No parameterization:
 
                    Specified by OFFSET ---.  (Both WOBBLE and UT1
                    use this syntax.)
 
               2. Parameterization style "0" (the traditional
               style, which estimates 0000 UTC offsets and rates):
 
 
                    Offsets - specified by OFFSET  XY- (for WOBBLE)
                    or OFFSET --U (for UT1).  The user can turn off
                    X- or Y-wobble by substituting a dash for that
                    parameter.
 
                    Rates - specified by RATE  XY- or RATE  --U.
                    (Again, the user can turn off X- or Y-wobble.)
                    Rates cannot be estimated unless offsets are
                    estimated.
 
               3. Parameterization style "1" (the new style, which
               estimates linear-piecewise continuous rates, etc.):
 
                    This style always automatically estimates an
                    offset and an unconstrained global rate at the
                    beginning of the experiment.  The user may
                    select up to three additional
                    parameterizations, using eop_type.  eop_type
                    must be DSR, where each letter turns on one of
                    the following choices and a dash in its place
                    turns it off:
 
                         D - estimates a diurnal sine.
 
                         S - estimates a semi-diurnal sine.
 
                         R - estimates constrained linear
                         piecewise-continuous rates.  The user must
                         also specify two real numbers, the
                         interval of the parameterization and the
                         constraint upon the rates, in that order.
                         These values have no default.  The
                         interval must be specified in hours, but
                         BATCH converts it to days.  The constraint
                         must be specified in mas/day for WOBBLE
                         and ms/day for UT1.  Readers should note
                         the difference between these constraints
                         and the ones for earth orientation in the
                         $CONSTRAINTS section.  The constraints in
                         the $CONSTRAINTS section apply to earth
                         orientation offsets, while the constraints
                         in this section apply to a specific type
                         of earth orientation rate.
 
                    The syntax for style "1" applies to both WOBBLE
                    and UT1.  This style parameterizes X- and Y-
                    wobble the same way.
 
     Field 2 - produces a file containing hourly UT1 and polar
     motion estimates and sigmas.
 
          OFF (or field omitted) - no file is produced.
 
          RESET - writes the values to WORK_DIR/EOPLxx, where xx are the Solve
                  user initials. Overwrites the previous contents of EOPLxx.
 
          APPEND - appends the values to EOPLxx.
 
     Each line of the file contains a five field time tag, then an estimate and
     sigma for X-wobble, then the Y-wobble values, then the UT1 values.
 
     Field 3 - calculates UT1/PM at the middle of experiment time.

   The NUTATION keyword determines how BATCH estimates the nutation parameters.
 
   NO - does not estimate nutation offsets.
 
   OFFSET    -- estimate daily offsets of nutation in longitude and
                nutation in obliquity using formalism of Newcomb-Andoyer.
                This forces Solve to put in listing in Sinex format

   XY_OFFSET -- estimate daily offsets of nutation in X and
                nutation in Y using formalism of Ginot-Capitaine.
                This forces Solve to put in listing in Sinex format

   NB: Solve puts estimates of nutation angles both for nutation in

   NO - suppresses all three types of output described below.
 
   For a given session, BATCH produces baseline components for any baselines
with a station whose position components are session parameters. Specifically,
BATCH produces the baseline's length, transverse and vertical components,
the magnitude of the baseline vector, and these values' sigmas. BATCH produces
this output as part of the session's session parameter output.
 
   Assuming BATCH estimates at least one station's position components as
global parameters, BATCH produces the above information for every pair of
stations in the solution, even if some of the resulting baselines have no
observations.  BATCH produces this output as part of the global parameter
output.
 
   Assuming BATCH estimates velocities in addition to global position
components at one or more stations, BATCH also produces rate of change
information for every pair of stations in the solution. Specifically BATCH
produces the rate of change of each baseline's length, transverse and vertical
components, the rate of change of each vector's magnitude, and these values'
sigmas. BATCH produces this output as part of the global parameter output.

   The COVARIANCES keyword determines what covariance output BATCH produces.
This option is obsolete and provided only for backward compatibility. There is
a restriction on the number of sessions and number of parameters which can
be supported by this option. These restrictions are installation specific.
It is recommended to use a keyword CORRELATIONS instead of.
 
   NO  - no covariance output.
 
   YES - produces output as follows:
 
         Field 1 - determines the extent to which BATCH produces the type
                   of covariance selected in field 2.  For example, if field 2
                   selects an session parameter, field 1 determines whether
                   BATCH produces the parameter's covariances for a single
                   session or for every session in the solution. Fields 1
                   and 2 must make sense when combined.  For example, if the
                   user chooses CGM for field 1, to produce global covariances,
                   then he/she must choose global parameters in field 2.
                   The $CARRY section identifies session and global parameters.
 
     ALL - produces the covariance matrix for the entire solution. Depending on
           field 2, this potentially includes covariances between global
           parameters, covariances between session parameters in a given
           session, and covariances between pairs of session and global
           parameters. ALL potentially generates a large amount of output,
           so users should select it carefully.
 
     CGM - produces a matrix for the covariances between the global parameters.
 
     BY_SESSION - produces the covariances between the session parameters in
                  a given session for every session in the solution.
                  Produces each session's covariances in a separate matrix.
 
     dbname ver - produces a matrix for the covariances between the session
                  parameters in the given session.
 
     Field 2 - the type(s) of covariances BATCH produces.
 
             STA - produces station position covariances.
 
             SOU - produces source coordinate covariances.
 
             EOP - produces covariances for the earth orientation parameters
                   selected in the $FLAGS section's UT1/PM keyword.
 
             NUT - produces covariances for the nutation parameters selected
                   in the $FLAGS NUTATION keyword.
 
             ALL - produces all of the above types.
 
     If the user selects ALL ALL, which generates covariances between different
sessions' parameters, he/she must make sure that the solution has an session
file for every session.
 
     BATCH writes the covariance output to the covariance file, $WORK_DIR/CVRFxx
file where xx are the solve user initials.

               &lt;ses_filename&gt; - File name with the session list. If the path
                                is omitted the file is sought in $SAVE_DIR/
 
               SES_EXCLUDE - specifies the filename with the list of the
                             sessions. Correlations between local parameters
                             for the sessions from this list will not be

   The STATION_TABLE keyword produces a table of projected X, Y and Z position
components, at noon on January 1, for 1979 through 1992, for each globally
estimated station.
 
   NO - not to produce the station table output (recommended).
 
   YES - produce the station table output. The form of the tables depends on
         the MINIMUM keyword:
 
   If MINIMUM = YES - each station's table has one line per year
                      containing the projected X, Y and Z position totals and
                      unscaled sigmas.
 
   If MINIMUM = NO  - each station's table has four lines per year.
                      Line 1 contains the projected correlations between the
                      station's position components and between each component's
                      position and velocity. Lines 2-4 contain the components'
                      projected position totals, estimates and unscaled and
                      scaled sigmas.
 
   BATCH uses velocities and a reference date to project the positions. BATCH
projects positions for 1979 through 1992, regardless of the solution's data
span.
 
   BATCH only produces tables for the XYZ coordinate system.

   When station positions and velocities are estimated then adjustments of
positions and the estimates of their uncertainties are referred to the
specified epoch. However, some stations participated only in a subset of
sessions. If the mean weighted epoch of the station observations substantially
differs from the reference epoch then the uncertainties of the station
positions increases. There exists an epoch such as the formal uncertainty of
the station position referred to that epoch is minimal. BATCH is able to
compute such an epoch for each station and compute the formal uncertainty for
the station positions referred to this epoch called "minimal sigmas".
 
   NO  - not to compute minimal sigmas.
 
   YES - compute minimal sigmas for each station whose positions and velocity
         are estimated as global parameters.

   Determines to generate a listing in SINEX format with results of the
parameters estimation related to the session. Currently, (2002.05.23) this
keyword is supported only for INDEPENDENT solution types and will be ignored
in global modes.
 
   NO     -- no output file of results in SINEX format is produced.

                      The format 2.20 differs from format 2.10 that it uses
                      alternative parameter names suggested by Markus
                      Rotather in 2008. As of July 2008, no exsiting Sinex

  This keyword puts pSolve in a special mode for computation of the
parameters of the ionospheric model used for processing single band
observations. No least square solution is made. This computation is
done in three steps: 1) extract information about VLBI ionospheric
path delay and GNSS TEC model; 2) adjust dTEC bias (for dual-band
observations only); and 3) compute uncertainty of the ionospheric
path delay from the GNSS TEC maps using a regression model.

   Some parameters can be treated either as global or as session parameters.
This section tells to BATCH how to treat these parameters. The user must
specify  a choice for these parameters. The $CARRY section must be preceded by
the $FLAGS section.
 
   The following table lists the current parameters and how BATCH treats them:
 
     Type              Parameters
 
     global or local   station positions, source coordinates
 
     always local      atmospheres, clocks, UT1/PM, parameters, nutation offset
 
     always global     station velocities, source proper motions, precession
                       and relativity parameters, antenna axis offsets.

   STATIONS     [YES or NO] {sta_comp} {EXCEPT (station ...\)}
</B></FONT>
 
   The STATIONS keyword in the CARRY section determines how BATCH treats the
station positions selected in the $FLAGS section.
 
   Fields 1 and 3 - used together to make a basic choice. Field 2 can then be
used, as described below, to partially override this choice.
 
   Field 1 -
 
           YES - treats every station position as a global parameter.
 
           NO -  treats every station position as a local parameter.
 
   Field 3 (the EXCEPT phrase) - treats the listed stations' positions as
                                 local parameters, if field 1 is YES, and
                                 as global parameters, if field 1 is NO.
 
   Field 2 (sta_comp) -
 
         sta_comp omitted - BATCH treats the station positions as described
                            above.
 
         sta_comp - partially overrides the basic choices made in fields 1
                    and 3.  sta_comp must be XYZ or UEN, with '-'s (dashes)
                    indicating components to be treated as session parameters
                    at every station, including stations listed in the EXCEPT
                    clause. BATCH ignores components not replaced by dashes,
                    except to make sure that they match the coordinate system
                    specified in the STATIONS keyword in the $FLAGS section.
                    So components not replaced by dashes will be treated as
                    specified in fields 1 and 3.
 
    Examples:
 
    1) STATIONS YES EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
       BATCH treats PT REYES' station position components as local parameters
       and all other station positions as global parameters.
 
    2) STATIONS NO EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
       BATCH treats PT REYES' station position components as global parameters
       and all other station positions as session parameters.
 
    3) STATIONS YES X-Z EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
       BATCH treats the station position components as follows:
 
       Stations other than PT REYES      PT REYES
 
 
       X components        Global        Local
       Y components        Local         Local
       Z components        Global        Local
 
     4) STATIONS NO -EN EXCEPT PT_REYES
 
        BATCH treats the station position components as follows:
 
                Stations other than PT REYES     PT REYES
       U components                 Local        Local
       E components                 Local        Global

   The AXIS keyword determines how BATCH treats the axis offset parameter
selected in the $FLAGS section.
 
           YES - treats axis offsets for the stations specified in the

                 position of a station are modeled by a linear spline or

                 axis offset for that station will be estimated.
 
           NO  - treats axis offsets for every station specified in the
                 $FLAGS AXIS section as session parameters.
 
  If the keyword is omitted, Solve assumes YES, i.e. treats axis offsets
for the stations specified in the $FLAGS AXIS section as global parameters.

</B></FONT>
 
   This keyword was created for special applications. Most users will want to
use WVR_MASK NO .
 
   DBCAL, the program which adds weather data to an session, tries to add
WVR corrections to each observation in the session. However, the corrections
may have been obtained by methods of varying quality. For example, one
observation's corrections may have been actually taken during the observation,
while another observation's corrections may have been interpolated from
surrounding observations. The WVR_MASK keyword rejects observations in which
one or both stations' corrections were obtained by specified methods.
 
   If the qualifier mask is omitted - BATCH does not reject any observation
based on its WVR corrections.
 
   If the qualifier mask is included - BATCH uses one or more bit masks to
determine which methods to reject at which stations. Without an EXCEPT phrase,
the same mask is used for every station. Station(s) in the EXCEPT phrase use
the mask preceding them.
 
   Bit WVR masks of zero - BATCH does not reject any observation based on the
existence or quality of its WVR corrections.
 
   Non-zero WVR bit masks - each method is assigned a bit position within all
the masks. Within a specific station mask, the user sets the bit to zero to
reject or to one to accept observations corrected by that method. The following
table tells which bit controls which method. In addition, all non-zero masks
reject observations without WVR corrections. The bit masks must be specified
as octal numbers.
 
 
   Bit number    Method
 
       1         The WVR correction was measured during the observation within
                 2 degrees of the source.
 
       2         The correction was mapped from zenith measurements made during
                 the observation.
 
       3         The correction was measured during the observation, but more
                 than 2 degrees from the source.
 
       4         The correction was interpolated from the two closest available
                 observations. These observations are within 30 minutes of the
                 desired observation's mid-epoch.
 
       5         Same as bit 4, except that the observations used for
                 interpolation are more than 30 minutes from the desired
                 observation's mid-epoch.
 
       6         The correction was extrapolated from other WVR data. The
                 correction could not be interpolated because WVR data only
                 existed on one side of the desired observation.
 
       7         The method cannot be determined.
 
 
Example
 
     WVR_MASK 0 EXCEPT 32 WESTFORD 45 KAUAI___ MOJAVE12
                                   177 GILCREEK
 
     An octal 32 has bits 2, 4 and 5 set to one, so BATCH only accepts
observations at WESTFORD if their WVR corrections were mapped from zenith
measurements made during the observation, or interpolated.  (The data used
for the interpolation can be less than or greater than 30 minutes from each
observation's mid-epoch).  An octal 45 has bits 1, 3 and 6 set to one, so
BATCH only accepts observations at KAUAI and MOJAVE12 if their WVR corrections
were measured during the observation (either greater than or less than
2 degrees from the source), or extrapolated from other observations. BATCH
throws out observations at all three stations if they have no WVR correction
for the station. Bits 1 through 7 are all set to one in 177, so observations
at GILCREEK are acceptable, as long as they have some WVR correction at
GILCREEK. No criteria are applied for any other station.

   Determines the sessions to which BATCH applies the ionosphere calibration.
This phrase also determines the sessions for which BATCH rejects observations
with bad or missing S-band ionospheric values, subject to restrictions stated
below. The keyword ION is ignored when the data type is an ionosphere free
linear combination of several observables.
 
   ON  - applies the calibration to every session. Rejects every observation
         with bad or missing S-band values, except those flagged in the
         session's superfile as manually reweighted. (This flag indicates that
         the analyst who made the superfile solution wanted the observation
         included despite its bad values, for other reasons.)  Users are
         strongly advised to select this option unless you are analyzing very
         short baselines (say, shorter than 5 km) when we can totally neglect
         ionosphere contribution. The other options create the risk of letting
         observations with bad residuals into the solution.
 
   OFF - does not apply the calibration to any session. Accepts every
         observation with bad or missing S-band values, except those that have
         bad quality codes or were manually rejected in the superfile solution
         for other reasons.

         calibration and reject or accept observations with bad values.

</B></FONT>
 
   DEFAULT tells to BATCH to handle the station-dependent calibrations and the
ionosphere calibration and editing in the ways recorded in each session's
superfile. Users who want to handle either issue differently must specify
a combination of the above phrases, as described below. Different keywords
are allowed in $CALIBRATIONS section. Usually ION and ALL corfile_display_name
keywords are specified.
 
   The remaining four phrases in this section (AVAILABLE, USE ...,
corfile_display_name ..., GROUP...) determine which calibrations BATCH applies.
 
   In all four phrases, corfile_display_name should be one of the names entered
in the first field in sections 10 and 20 of the LIPTN corfil ($WORK_DIR/CORFLP).
Only the first eight characters are significant. For example, to specify Marini
dry, the user should specify dry_Mari or dry_Marini, not MARI.DRY or MARISTAT.
Users should replace any blanks with '_'s (underscores). The suggested forms
of some commonly used calibrations are Chao, cable, dry_Marini, wet_Marini,
WVR, CFAKBDRY, CFAKBWET, CFA22DRY, and CFAJJDRY.
 
   When BATCH processes an session, it initially sets up the calibrations
the way they are set up in the session's superfile. BATCH then modifies that
set up according to the last three phrases in this section. First it turns
the specified calibrations in the corfile_display_name and GROUP phrases on
and off. Then it processes any USE phrases, substituting certain calibrations
for others if the latter are turned on after the other modifications.
 
   BATCH only performs whatever instructions it is given in this section.
It does not turn off one calibration when told to turn on a conflicting one.
For example, if an session's superfile has Marini dry turned on, and the user
wants to turn on CFAKBDRY instead, he/she must explicitly turn off Marini dry
or else use CFAKBDRY for Marini dry. If the user just turns on CFAKBDRY, BATCH
leaves marini dry on as well. So users should be careful to give BATCH a full
set of instructions covering every calibration which may be in their solutions'
superfiles. Specifying corfile_display_name ON or corfile_display_name OFF
for every calibration accomplishes this and is strongly recommended.

   Keyword AVAILABLE determines which flyby calibrations are currently
available.
 
   The available flyby calibrations are now listed in flycal_avail on
$SAVE_DIR. AVAILABLE tells to BATCH to read this file.  For backwards
compatibility, AVAILABLE can still be followed by a list of flyby calibrations.
However, BATCH now ignores the list.
 
   Whenever a standard flyby calibration is missing from flycal_avail, users
should consult a SOLVE programmer or check the socal subroutine before entering
the calibration again. The calibration may be temporarily disabled due to
problems.
 
   Users should always specify this phrase. BATCH cannot use flyby calibrations
without it, and it has no harmful effects in solutions which do not use flyby
calibrations.

   Users are strongly advised to use this phrase to explicitly turn EVERY

cases in which an session has no calibration or too many calibrations turned on.

   After BATCH uses the other phrases to set up an session's calibrations,
if the second calibration in this phrase is turned on, BATCH turns on the first
one instead.  If the substitute is not available or is already turned on,
BATCH aborts.
 
   If the second calibration is not turned on, this phrase has no effect.
 
Examples
 
     GROUP dry_Mari wet_Mari WVR PICK dry_Mari wet_Mari ELSE dry_Mari
 
     BATCH first tries to turn on dry and wet Marini and turn off the WVR
calibration.  If one or both of the Marini calibrations are unavailable in
an session, BATCH tries to turn on dry Marini alone. If this is unavailable,
BATCH aborts.
 
     ELSE DEFAULT
 
     Appending ELSE DEFAULT to the previous example makes sure that BATCH does
not abort, if the PICK and ELSE selections fail. However, this is a mixed
blessing.  What BATCH turns on in this case depends on what was turned on in
the session's superfile solution.  Dry (and probably therefore wet) Marini are
out of the picture, leaving the WVR calibration. If this was on in the
solution, BATCH leaves it on, replacing the desired Marini calibrations with
one the user didn't request and may not notice being used for the session.
If WVR was off, BATCH leaves it off, probably leaving the session without any
calibrations, since the user presumably did not choose any other calibrations
if he/she was hoping to get the Marini calibrations.

   SET - applies the listed contributions to every session and doesn't apply
         any other calibration not listed in the section $CONTRIBUTIONS. More
         than one SET keywords are allowed. Thus, if you are going apply several
         contributions, it is better to puit several SET-statments, one
         statement for each contribution.
 
   &lt;contribution_name&gt; - is the name of the calibration. The list of supported
names can be in section 40 of the corfil used for making superfiles ( f.e.
$WORK_DIR/CORFLP ). BATCH applies only the contributions specified by
keywords SET and doesn't apply contribution not listed there. If at least
one contribution is specified in the control file but not found in the
superfile, BATCH will issues an error message and terminate.
 
   NB: '_' (Underscore character) should be used instead of blank if the
contribution contains a blank. For example, to specify pole tide, the user
should specify Pol_Tide, not PTD CONT.
 
   NB: contribution names are case sensitive!

   This section replaces a priori calculated from a standard theoretical model
and read from the sessions' superfiles with alternate a priori. This process
is called mapping. All keywords from the section contains a value
file_descriptor. If the first character of the &lt;file_descriptor&gt; is "/"
then the name is interpreted as a name with absolute path. Otherwise the
prefix $SAVE_DIR/ is prepended before the name. By the another words BATCH
seeks the files in $SAVE_DIR directory unless full file name including path
is specified. Restriction: the full file name after expansion should have
no more than 128 symbols. It is strongly recommended ALWAYS to use mapping
files for ALL stations, ALL sources for all kind of solutions. Superfiles may
contain different a priori for the same stations, sources in different
sessions. If Solve detects such a situation it terminates the run.

(4X, 4A2, 1X, D15.11, 1X, D15.11, 1X, D15.11). BATCH assigns unlisted stations
a velocity of zero, although it is a bad practice. If Solve doesn't find
the station in the velocity substitution file it issues a warning (unless
a keyword WARNING was set to NO in the $SETUP section). Comments may be placed
anywhere within the file, preceded by $$. The first line of a valid velocity
substitution file contains a reference epoch data in the format YYYY.MM.DD
(f.e. 2000.05.08 ) or yymmmdd (f.e. 970101)
 
   In both methods(PLATE_MODEL and VELOCITIES, BATCH assumes that every
station started at a specific position at the reference epoch. If this
sections STATIONS keyword specifies a file, BATCH uses its positions for the
reference positions of the stations in that file. BATCH uses the superfile
positions for the remaining stations or if STATIONS is NONE.
 
NB: VELOCITY and PLATE_MODEL cannot be used both.

   This is obsolecent keyword. Use SPLINE_POS instead of it.
 
   The EPISODIC_MOTION keyword tells to Solve to estimate a break in station
positions of global station at the specified epochs. It is assumed that the
station position has a discontinuity(ies) at the epoch of break(s) for
some reasons, e.g., due to earthquake or rails repairing or whatever other
reasons. If one break epoch is specified then two estimates of station positions
are adjusted: the first estimates is obtained over all observations before
the break epoch and the second station positions are estimated over all
observations after the clock break. But the estimates of velocity doesn't have
breaks, so if station velocity is adjusted then it is adjusted over all
observations both before the break and after the break. Unlimited number of
breaks can be specified but at least one sessions with good observations at
the station under consideration should take place between the epochs of
clock breaks.
 
   Keyword EPISODIC_MOTION is ignored for INDEPENDENT solution types or for
the stations those positions are considered as local parameters. This
keyword is incompatible with PIECE_WISE_STA and SPLINE_POS keywords.
 
   NONE - estimates every station's position components as specified in the
          $FLAGS and $CARRY STATIONS keywords (as local parameters or as one
          set of global components based on every session in the solution).
 
   file_name - BATCH estimates each listed station's components at the listed
               epochs, as well as at the start of the experiment. BATCH
               estimates the position at each epoch based on the data in the
               interval between it and the next epoch.
 
   The user must treat each listed station's position components as global
parameters. BATCH estimates the components in whatever coordinate system is
given in the $FLAGS section's STATIONS keyword.
 
   Each line in file_name must list a station (columns 1 - 8) and an epoch
(columns 10 - 15). Comments may occur anywhere in the file, preceded by an
asterisk.
 
   This keyword does not affect the way BATCH estimates velocities.

   This keyword allows user to apply an eccentricity substitution file.
The eccentricity file defines a vector from the dome reference points to the
antenna reference point for each station for the specified interval of time.
Solve supports eccentricity file format ECC v. 1.0 . The purpose of the
eccentricity file is to model slow local motion of the antenna with respect to
the local marks. Originally this file was designed for specifying eccentricity
vector for mobile stations for each campaign. However, each station should
have at least one record (eccentricity is usually set to zero for fixed
antennas) and each antenna, including large fixed antennas, may have proper
local motion, e.g. due to antenna rail repairing, post-seismic notion or
whatever reason an analyst finds appropriate.
 
   The values of eccentricity vectors from the external eccentricity file
supersedes eccentricity values saved in the superfile.
 
   Each valid eccentricity file of ECC-format v 1.0 has the first line
# ECC-FORMAT V 1.0   ECCENTRICITY FILE
   and the last line
# ECC-FORMAT V 1.0   ECCENTRICITY FILE (trailing line)
 
   Lines with the first symbol $ are considered as comments and ignored. Other
lines should contain definitions of eccentricity vector for each epoch:
$  ( 3:10)  IVS station name
$  (12:15)  Monument number
$  (18:33)  Starting date of validity of the eccentricity vector
$           (18:21)  Year  of starting date of validity
$           (23:24)  Month of starting date of validity
$           (26:27)  Day of month of starting date of validity
$           (29:30)  Hour (UTC) of starting date of validity
$           (32:33)  Minute (UTC) of starting date of validity
$  (36:51)  Ending date of validity of validity of the eccentricity vector
$           (36:39)  Year  of ending date of validity
$           (41:42)  Month of ending date of validity
$           (44:45)  Day of month of ending date of validity
$           (47:48)  Hour (UTC) of ending date of validity
$           (50:51)  Minute (UTC) of ending date of validity
$  (54:63)  First coordinate of eccentricity (in meters)
$  (65:74)  Second coordinate of eccentricity (in meters)
$  (76:85)  Third coordinate of eccentricity (in meters)
$  (88:90)  Type of eccentricity data. Set meaning of eccentricity coordinates.
$           Two types are supported:
$           NEU  -- 1-st coordinate is a north projection;
$                   2-nd coordinate is an east projection;
$                   3-rd coordinate is a vertical projection directed up
$                        (more precisely speaking it is directed along
$                         a normal to the ellipsoid)
$           XYZ  -- 1-st coordinate is a X-coordinate in crust fixed system;
$                   2-nd coordinate is a Y-coordinate in crust fixed system;
$                   3-rd coordinate is a Z-coordinate in crust fixed system.
 
NB: Solve before 1999.10.15 kept eccentricity vector only up to 1mm.
Discrepancies in the estimates of positions of some stations when an
eccentricity file in the ECC v 1.0 format is used may reach 0.7mm due to
rounding errors.

   Comment: this is an obsolete keyword. it is recommended to use
NO_NET_TRANSLATION_POSITION instead of NO_NET_TRASNLATION.
 
   This keyword allows user to impose weighted no-net-translation constraints
at station positions considered as LOCAL parameters constraints for each
session. (You should use NO_NET_TRANSLATION_POSITION if you are going to apply
constraints on station positions considered as GLOBAL parameters).
 
   NO  - not use
   YES - applies this constraints with station_weight_file.
   station_weight_file - file which contains relative weights of constraints.
                         If the qualifier is omitted then the file defined
                         in $MK5_ROOT/progs/solve/include/gsfcb.i in variable
                         STATION_WEIGHT_FILE
 
   Three equations of constraints are built: for X, Y, and Z coordinates of
station positions. Equations of constraints are the weighted sum of station
coordinates. These sums are constrained to zero. Sigma of the constraint
is defined in the constant LIN_STA__SIG__DEF .
 
    NB: if the file station_weight_file does not contain some stations,
solution may appear singular. As a rule of thumb station_weight_file should
contain ALL statations, although Solve doesn't have a mechanism to check it
and to warn a user.

   This keyword allows to impose net translation constraints applied to
station position parameters.
 
   Field 1 (what to do)
 
         NO - not to apply constraints.
 
   Field 2
 
         GLOBAL - in global mode, means to apply constraints on stations
                  estimated as global parameters. In independent mode this
                  parameter means nothing.
 
         LOCAL  - in global mode, means to apply constraints on stations
                  estimated as local parameters. In independent mode this
                  parameter means nothing.
 
         If both GLOBAL and LOCAL are omitted, then GLOBAL is used as default.
         It is recommended that at least one of the qualifiers should be used.
 
   Field 3
 
         SIGMA - specifies sigma of constraint
 
         value_in_meter - sigma of constraint in meters
 
   Field 4 (type of equations)
 
         ALL - total form of the constraint is chosen. Three equations
               of constraints are built: for X, Y, and Z coordinates of station
               positions. Equations of constraints are the sum of station
               coordinates. These sums are constrained to zero.
 
         HORIZ - horizontal form of constraint is chosen. Three equations
                 of horizontal projections of station positions vectors are
                 formed: for X, Y, and Z coordinates of the vectors of
                 horizontal projections. Equations of constraints are the sum
                 these projections over all stations. These sums are
                 constrained to zero.
 
   Field 5 (type of weights)
 
         UNIFORM - equal weights for all stations used in constraints.
 
         WEIGHTED - unequal weights for each station will be applied.
                    Weights were used are the diagonal values from this CGM

   This section has two purposes. It suppresses specific global parameters.
It also imposes certain restrictions on the estimates BATCH produces.
For example, BATCH can produce identical velocity estimates for a group of
(closely located) stations.
 
NB: Special care should be taken when using options in $SUPPRESSION.
A user should understand very clear what he/she is going. BATCH checks only
syntax. It is very easy to get completely wrong results when suppression is
used incorrectly.
 
   The $FLAGS section must precede this section.
 
   NONE turns off both functions of this section.  To suppress global
parameters or restrict parameter estimation, the user must specify one or more
of the following options in any combination.  The VELOCITIES, STATIONS,
SOURCES, PROPER_MOTIONS, PRECESSION, RELATIVITY, and TIDES options suppress
parameters. The DIRECTION, RIGHT_ASCENSION, STATION_ORIGIN, VELOCITY_ORIGIN
and VELOCITY_TIE options restrict parameter estimation.
 
   Readers should keep in mind that in the $SUPPRESSION keywords that suppress
parameters, the syntax is the reverse of the syntax in the other control file
sections.  That is, in the rest of the control file, specifying things or
choosing YES turns things on, and not specifying them or choosing NO turns
things off. In this section, the opposite is true: YES means to suppress
parameter, NO -- not to suppress.
 
Example:
 
   RELATIVITY YES
   RELATIVITY NO
 
  RELATIVITY NO in the $FLAGS section and RELATIVITY YES in the $SUPPRESSION
section keep BATCH from estimating the parameter gamma Post-Newtonian theories
of gravitation. RELATIVITY YES in the $FLAGS section and RELATIVITY NO in the
$SUPPRESSION section estimate it.

           The specific coordinates are determined by the src_comp preceding
           each source. Src_comp must be specified as in field 1.
 
Examples
 
     1) SOURCES YES EXCEPT -- 2345-167
 
     BATCH suppresses every right ascension and declination for every source
     except 2345-167. In other words, BATCH only estimates 2345-167's right
     ascension and declination.
 
     2) SOURCES NO EXCEPT R- 0048-097 -D 0106+013 2345-167
 
     BATCH suppresses three coordinates, 0048-097's right ascension
     and 0106+013 and 2345-167's declinations.  That is, BATCH
     estimates the right ascension and declination of every source,
     except 0048-097 (declination ascension only), 0106+013 (right ascension
     only) and 2345-167(right ascension only).
 
     SOURCES R- EXCEPT RD 2134+00 0048-097
 
     BATCH suppresses every source's right ascension and also
     suppresses 2134+00 and 0048-097's both right ascension and declinations.
     That is, BATCH estimates every declination except those of 2134+00 and
     0048-097.

   The PROPER_MOTIONS keyword suppresses source proper motions.
 
     Field 1 -
 
           YES - suppresses every source's proper motions.
 
           NO - does not suppress any source's proper motions.
 
           src_comp - suppresses specific proper motions (for every source).
                      Its format is RD, where '-'s (dashes) replace proper
                      motions that should not be suppressed.
           RD    means to suppress both right ascension and declination;
           R-    means to suppress right ascension only;
           -D    means to suppress declination only;
           --    means to suppress nothing;
 
     Field 2 -
 
           Suppresses alternate sets of proper motions for the listed sources.
           The specific proper motions are determined by the src_comp preceding
           each source. stc_comp must be specified as in field 1.
 
     The PROPER MOTIONS keyword is analogous to the SOURCES keyword, and users
should refer to that keyword's examples.

   Keyword DIRECTION forces to estimate station 1's velocity in such a way that
the total azimuth vector from station_1 to station_2 keeps the same orientation
as the a priori vector. (BATCH permits the vectors' magnitudes to differ.)
In essence, this option constrains station 1 to move away from or towards
station 2, along the cord connecting them along the Earth's surface.
This eliminates degrees of freedom, producing a minimum constraint solution.

   The keyword VELOCITY_TIE imposes strong constraints on the difference

   The keyword VELOCITY_TIE allows to specify more than one list of tied
stations. The qualifier AND should be used as a delimiter of lists. If two

    It means that a) three stations, DSS65 ROBLED32 MADTRID64, will
                     be analyzed in such a manner that the adjustments
                     of their velocity will be the same and

   The $ARCS section lists the session names which are to participate in the
solution. Suppression solutions do not process sessions, but must specify
a session in this section in order to activate the proper BATCH paths.
 
   The arc section may contain either the session list itself or the filename
which actually contains the list. The format of the station list in both
cases is the same.
 
   The arc-list consists of lines of variable length. Each line contains
the name of the session and, perhaps, some options or contains and * symbol
in he first field what is an indication that this line is a comment and
therefore is ignored by BATCH.
 
NB: An empty line means the end of the arc-list. Batch doesn't look at the

  The SUPPRESS_FILE specifies the name of the so-called suppression file
or NONE if this function is not needed. SUPPRESS_FILE specifies the list
of parameters or their index which are to be suppressed. Lines which
starts from # are considered as comments and ignored. One record specifies
one suppressed parameter. It can be either in the form of a 20 characters
long internal SOLVE parameter name or in the form of a parameter index.
Solve first tries to interpret the record as a parameter index. If the
record is an integer in the range [1, n_par], where the n_par is the total
number of parameters in the solution, then the record is considered as
a parameter index. If Solve fails to interpret this number as a parameter
index, it tires to interpret it as as a parameter name. If it cannot find
parameter with such a name, it generates the error message and stops.
 
  If a solution runs in global mode, only global parameters can be suppressed.
If a solution runs in the independent mode, any parameter can be suppressed.
 
  It should be noted the SUPPRESS_FILE option should be used only as a last
resort for correcting errors in parameterization.

       MOST -- uses the constraint sigma which is the maximum between the
               specified constraint and the constraint for that station
               saved in the superfile. By another words, the requested

                  then and only then this counter can be omitted.
                  If the parser detects that the first parameter
                  after the keyword  ATMOSPHERE_OFF,  it considers
                  nsites=1 and treats the first parameter as the
                  name of the site.
 
       site1 sites ... -- list of sites. If a site has a blank inside the

                     parameterization with the given interval at each
                     station, unless the session's superfile contains
                     a linear piecewise-continuous parameterization with
                     a shorter interval. Then BATCH uses that interval.

                   then and only then this counter can be omitted.
                   If the parser detects that the first parameter

                      of the experiment, and that frequency is used for
                      computation of ionospheric contribution for the single
                      band observation or the ionospheric-free linear
                      combination of dual-band observables.
 
                      The effective ionospheric frequency depends on IF
                      weights, and in general, differs from an observation
                      to observation within several pro cents. Therefore, Solve
                      supports observation-dependent effective ionospheric
                      frequencies, and the use of observation-dependent
                      effective ionospheric frequencies in most cases residual
                      residuals.
 
                      However, there are two cases when observation-dependent
                      effective ionospheric frequency can degrade, sometimes
                      significantly, the fit.
 
                      1) ionospheric frequencies can be wrong for some
                         observations due to bugs in visibility analysis.
 
                      2) group delays between low and high bands may have
                         a significant constant offset. This offset can be
                         due to different path delay in the signal chain or
                         due to ambiguity in phase calibration. When the
                         ionosphere-free path delay is computed, the
                         difference in group delays is multiplied by the
                         expression that depends on effective ionospheric
                         frequencies. If the effective ionospheric frequency
                         has a jitter due to differences in IF weights,
                         the constant difference is group delay will by
                         multiplied by this jitter which will be added to
                         o-c and will cause and additional noise.
 
                      In cases 1-2, setting EQUAL_EFF_FREQ improves results.
 
                      NB: Solve honors environment variable EQUAL_EFF_FREQ.
                      If it value is YES, then EQUAL_EFF_FREQ is applied to
                      all observing sessions.

                      that will be multiplied by the a priori TEC for all the
                      stations. TEC_SCA: has effect only for processing
                      single-band data type.
 
 
    TYPE  -- keyword determines which type of data will be used.
 
           GDR, GD, PDR, PD - (obsolete format) uses the specified data type.
                             G and
                             P indicate group versus phase data.
                             D indicates delay data only, and
                             DR indicates delay and rate data.
 
          GRPRAT, PHSRAT, SNBRAT, GRPONL, PHSONL, SNBONL, RATONL, G_GXS,
          PX_GXS, PS_GXS, PX_GX, PX_GS, PS_GX, PS_GS, P_PXS, GX, GS, PX, PS
 
          specifies the flag of the data type for processing this session.
          It is a linear combination of phase delay, group delay, single
          band delay, delay rate at different bands
 
    VTD_CONF control_file -- this keyword specifies the name of the control
                             file for VTD. This option will force BATCH
                             Solve to re-calculate theoretical time delay,
                             delay rate and partial derivatives on the fly
                             completely ignoring Calc.
