00000 *                                                                     *
00000 *  This is a CORFIL file which is used by SOLVE to set up a status of *
00000 *  calibrations computed by Calc 9.1 and other programs. Calibrations *
00000 *  (or contributions) are corrections to a theoretical time delay and *
00000 *  delay rate which are added to the total theoreticals in making     *
00000 *  equations of conditions. Contributions/calibrations are saved in   *
00000 *  the database and are added on the fly. Each calibration has an     *
00000 *  associated lcode: acronym under which it is saved in the database  *
00000 *  and it has a status: one of Applied, Not applied or Not Available. *
00000 *  SOLVE supports 4 types of calibrations/contributions:              *
00000 *                                                                     *
00000 *  1) Station-dependent non-flyby calibrations. They are applied to   *
00000 *     all observations of the station. Calibrations are computed      *
00000 *     for delay and rate. Up to MAX_CAL station-dependent             *
00000 *     calibrations can be specified.                                  *
00000 *                                                                     *
00000 *  2) Station-dependent zenith calibrations. They are multiplied by   *
00000 *     a mapping function which is currently in use and are applied to *
00000 *     all observation of the station. Calibrations are computed for   *
00000 *     delay and rate. Up to MAX_CLZ station-dependent zenith          *
00000 *     calibrations can be specified.                                  *
00000 *                                                                     *
00000 *  3) Observation-dependent calibrations. They are applied for all    *
00000 *     observations of the session. Calibrations are computed          *
00000 *     for delay and rate. Up to MAX_CONT observation-dependent        *
00000 *     calibrations can be specified.                                  *
00000 *                                                                     *
00000 *  4) Mode calibrations. They are applied for all observations of the *
00000 *     session. Calibrations are computed separately for               *
00000 *       a) group delay at X-band;                                     *
00000 *       b) phase delay at X-band;                                     *
00000 *       c) delay rate  at X-band;                                     *
00000 *       d) group delay at S-band;                                     *
00000 *       e) phase delay at S-band;                                     *
00000 *       f) delay rate  at S-band                                      *
00000 *     and a linear combination of calibrations of the same type is    *
00000 *     applied in according with the current solution type. Up to      *
00000 *     MAX_CLM mode calibrations can be specified.                     *
00000 *                                                                     *
00000 *  This file is a template. It might be edit and then should be       *
00000 *  copied to SAVE_DIR. The program solve_reset copies this file to    *
00000 *  a user scratch directory under the name CORFxx, where xx are user  *
00000 *  initials. The latter file is actually used by SOLVE: by programs   *
00000 *  SDBH and ACCOR, unless an environment variable CORFIL is specified.*
00000 *                                                                     *

00000 *  lcodes, default status and some other informations.                *
00000 *                                                                     *

00000 *    4) Section 40 -- definition of observation-dependent cals;       *
00000 *    5) Section 41 -- default status of observation-dependent cals;   *
00000 *    6) Section 42 -- the list of observation-dependent calibrations  *
00000 *                     which have been applied by Calc.                *
00000 *    7) Section 50 -- definition of mode calibrations.                *
00000 *    8) Section 51 -- default status of mode calibrations.            *

00000 *  Enter up to MAX_CAL non-flyby station dependent calibrations,      *
00000 *  (calibrations at elevation), one per line, numbering them          *
00000 *  (double digit numbers in columns 4 and 5, single digits in         *
00000 *  column 5).  Number consecutively, starting with 1.  In columns 8   *
00000 *  through 15, enter the name of the calibration (8 characters).      *
00000 *  This name will be used for display (eg, on the ACCOR menu that     *
00000 *  lets users see what calibrations are turned on).  So users can     *
00000 *  enter whatever they want. (However, the CORFIL which will be used  *
00000 *  the program which makes superfiles: liptn must enter specific,     *
00000 *  standard names in this field, because these names will be written  *
00000 *  to superfiles and BATCH must match them against names in BATCH     *
00000 *  control files.)                                                    *
00000 *  In columns 26-33, enter the data base lcode (8 characters)         *
00000 *  containing the actual values which will be applied to the          *
00000 *  theoreticals, if the calibration is turned on.  In columns 43-50,  *
00000 *  enter the data base LCODE (8 characters) for the list of stations  *
00000 *  for which the calibration is available. The remaining two fields   *
00000 *  (columns 58 and 59, and columns 62 and 63), are factors for        *
00000 *  getting the calibration values into SOLVE with the right signs.    *
00000 *  The first field handles the values for the first station in an     *
00000 *  observation, and the second field handles the values for the       *
00000 *  second station.                                                    *
00000 *  SDBH reads the calibrations for delay and rates for each station   *
00000 *  from the data base, multiplies them by the station's factor, and   *
00000 *  puts these values in the obsfil.  Get_calib then adds the obsfil   *
00000 *  values to the theoreticals.                                        *

00000 *  26-33).  In addition to the elevation calibration values, this     *
00000 *  LCODE contains the zenith calibration values,                      *
00000 *  which can be displayed, but not applied to the theoreticals.       *

00000 *  Enter up to 5 mode calibrations, one per line. Number them in      *
00000 *  column 5 consecutively, starting with 1. In columns 8-15, enter    *
00000 *  the name of the contribution (8 characters). This name will be     *
00000 *  used for display (eg, on the ACCOR menu that lets users see what   *
00000 *  contributions are turned on). So users can enter whatever they     *
00000 *  want.  (However, the CORFIL for the program which makes            *
00000 *  superfiles: liptn, must enter specific, standard names in this     *
00000 *  column, so that BATCH can match the superfile contributions with   *
00000 *  the BATCH control file ones.) In columns 26-33, enter the data     *
00000 *  base LCODE (8 characters) that contains the actual values which    *
00000 *  will be applied to the theoreticals, if the contribution is        *
00000 *  turned on.                                                         *

00000 *  This section is analogous to section 21, except that it lists      *
00000 *  mode calibrations, not calibrations, that should be turned on for  *
00000 *  a data base that has not been analyzed.  List up to 4 names per    *
00000 *  line, in free field format. NOTE:  Any blanks embedded within a    *
00000 *  name MUST BE replaced by underscores (_), in order to allow proper *
00000 *  parsing of the free field format. Use up to 5 lines. If the data   *
00000 *  base has been analyzed, SOLVE will turn on contributions recorded  *
00000 *  in the data base.  Otherwise, SOLVE will try to turn on the        *
00000 *  contributions in this section, one list (line) at a time. If none  * 
00000 *  work, then SOLVE will leave every contribution turned off.         *
00000 *  Program ACCOR has a function "Initialize" for setting all          *
00000 *  contributions in according with section 51: contributions which    *
00000 *  are available and listed in the section 51 will be turn on while   *
00000 *  all other contributions will be turned off.                        *
