! NERS forecast consists of static variables:
!
! a) declaration (character strings)
! b) dimensions  (integer numbers)
! c) initial epochs (real*8 numbers. Epochs are defined as number of seconds elapsed since 2001.01.01_00:00:00.0 TAI)
!
! and dynamic arrays of real*8 numbers with dimensions declared above:
!
! d) arrays of arguments for B-spline, harmonic, and cross-harmonic expansions
! e) arrays of coefficients of B-spline, harmonic or cross-harmonic expansions
