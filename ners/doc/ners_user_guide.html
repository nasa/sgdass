<H2> Introduction </H2>

  NERS library interface provides 6 public routines. Routine 
<EM class="proc">ners_init</EM> is called before any other 
<EM class="ners">NERS</EM> functions. It specifies <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> 
control file and the time range of intended EOP use.
Time in <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> library is the interval elapsed since 
2000.01.01_00:00:00.0  in TAI time scale. Units of time are seconds. Instead 
of time, events are often get tags of UTC function. In order to convert UTC tag 
to TAI time, <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> provides function 
<EM class="proc">ners_get_utcmtai</EM> that returns function UTC minus TAI on 
the specified timetag UTC. Routine <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM> initializes 
internal data structure of <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> object that is defined 
in <EM class="val">ners.i</EM> or <EM class="val">ners.h</EM>include block. 
This object is then passed to any other <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> function. 
<EM class="ners">NERS</EM> provides either the vector Earth orientation 
parameters on the specified moment of time or the table of the Earth orientation 
series for the specified range of time and the specified time step. At the end, 
function <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM> releases memory acquired by 
<EM class="proc">ners_init</EM>.
<P>

  The Earth orientation can be described either as a 3&times;3 rotation
matrix that transforms a Cartesian vector from the rotating terrestrial
coordinate system to the inertial non-rotating celestial coordinate
system or as parameters on which this matrix depends. For practical needs
the rotation matrix and its time derivatives are sufficient to perform
astronomical reduction for Earth's rotation. However, <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> 
also provides the parameters that describes the Earth's rotation on which the 
rotation matrix depends as well. These parameters are empirical corrections to
a deterministic model. Since the Earth's rotation depends on motion of 
the hydrosphere and atmosphere, it cannot be described with a deterministic
model with the accuracy comparable with accuracy of observations and should
be continuously monitored using space geodesy observations. For historical
reasons several alternative Earth orientation parameters were used. For
instance. For instance the rate of change of the angular variable along
the axis 3, i.e. the axial motion can be described as Euler angle 3,
UT1 rate, or the length of day. <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> provides many 
alternative Earth orientation parameters. These parameters are not independent.


<H2> Use cases </H2>

<UL>
    <LI> Transform a Carthesian vector of station coordinates in the terrestrial
         coordinate system to the inertial celestial coordinate system 
         at the specified moment of time. All you need is to call three 
         NERS routines: <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM>, <EM class="proc">ners_get_eop</EM>,
         <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM>. First, you run <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM> and
         specify the time range. If you need to compute the rotation matrix only for 
         one epoch, the range may be just &pm; 10 seconds. If you are going to 
         compute the transformation matrix for a number of epochs, just specify TAI time 
         of the earliest and the lastest epoch. The artgument time is 64-bit float
         number of seconds elapsed since 2000.01.01_00:00:00.0 TAI. Second, you run 
         <EM class="proc">ners_get_eop</EM> and specify the time. The type of the
         EOP is "mat". A product of this mastrix with the Carthesian vector of station 
         coordinates in the terrestrial coordinate system will transform it to the 
         inertial celestial coordinate system. If you need the transfromation matrix
         for a number of epochs, you call <EM class="proc">ners_get_eop</EM> in a cycle.
         Finally, you call <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM> to release dynamic memory
         allocated by <EM class="ners">NERS</EM>.
         <P>
         See <EM class="val">example/ners_fortran_example_01.f</EM> and 
             <EM class="val">example/ners_c_example_01.c</EM>.

         </LI><P>
         
    <LI> Get TAI time for a given UTC timetag. It is rather common to have value of
         of the non-differntiable function of time UTC(t) for events instead of time 
         TAI. In order to process such data you need to convert UTC timetag to TAI
         moment of time. All you need is to call three NERS routines: 
         <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM>, <EM class="proc">ners_get_utcmtai</EM>,
         <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM>. First, you run <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM> and
         specify the time range. If you are going to compute convert UTC to TAI 
         for a number of epochs, just specify TAI time of the earliest and the lastest 
         epoch. Second, you run <EM class="proc">ners_get_utcmtai</EM> and specify 
         the UTC timetag elapsed since epoch 2000.01.01_00:00:00.0 UTC. The routine
         returns function UTC minus TAI. Substracting this function from UTC you 
         tet TAI time: TAI = UTC - UTC_M_TAI. If you need transfrom UTC time tag to TAI
         for a number of epochs, you call <EM class="proc">ners_get_utcmtai</EM>
         in a cycle. Finally, you call <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM> to release 
         dynamic memory allocated by <EM class="ners">NERS</EM>.
         <P>
         See <EM class="val">example/ners_fortran_example_02.f</EM> and 
             <EM class="val">example/ners_c_example_02.c</EM>.

         </LI><P>

    <LI> Get the last time epoch of the short-term EOP forecast. You need call three 
         NERS routines: <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM>, <EM class="proc">ners_inq</EM>,
         <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM>. First, you run <EM class="proc">ners_init</EM> and
         specify the time range. For this case the range may be just &pm; 10 seconds
         of the current moment. Second, you run <EM class="proc">ners_inq</EM> wioth 
         request parameter "range". The routine returns three parameters:
         start time for EOP assimilaiton, stop time of the short-term EOP forecast,
         and stop time of the long-term prediction. Time is in seconds elapsed since
         2000.01.01_00:00:00.0 TAI. Finally, you call <EM class="proc">ners_quit</EM> 
         to release dynamic memory allocated by <EM class="ners">NERS</EM>.
         <P>
         See <EM class="val">example/ners_fortran_example_04.f</EM> and 
             <EM class="val">example/ners_c_example_04.c</EM>.

  <LI> <EM class="proc">ners_get_eop</EM> &mdash; returns array of the Earth 
               Orientation Parameters on the specified moment of time. The type of 
               Earth orientation parameter is defined in variable cpar.

               downloads the NERS message and prepares the interpolating
               polynomials for the specified time range, computes intermediate
               angles and expand them into B-spline basis over the specified
               time period. Then it computes the requested Earth orientation
               parameters. When it is called the next time, it reuses the 
               B-spline coefficients computed previously, unless more than 
               20 minutes elapsed from the computation of the coefficients.
