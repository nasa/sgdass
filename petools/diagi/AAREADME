  DiaGI (Dialogue Graphic Interface) is a library of subroutines which allows
to draw the plot of one or several one-dimension functions BY USING ONLY ONE
CALL OPERATOR, then interactively change if necessary boundaries of the 
plotting area, point style, line style, line width, error bar style, to make 
hardcopy in PostScript or GIF format with or without sending it at the printing
device and eventually to return to execution of the calling program. DiaGI 
makes work with graphic as easy as possible and frees user from cumbersome 
graphic programming. 

 DiaGI uses popular graphic package PGPLOT 
( http://astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/ ).
