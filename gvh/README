Library GVH provides a set of routines that implement the database 
handler for analysis of group delays computed from processing 
geodetic and absolute astronomy VLBI observtions.

In addition to that, several executables are provided for
transformation of database files from binary to ascii and
from ascii to binary representation, and for some other 
useful manulipations with database files that are needed
for data analysis.

See doc subdirectory for a detailed documentation.
