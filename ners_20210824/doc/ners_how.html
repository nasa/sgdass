<H1> How the Network Earth Rotation Service is working </H1>
<P>
   The Network Earth Rotation Service (<EM class="ners">NERS</EM>) consists
ot two segments: server and client.

<H2> NERS server segment </H2>

   The <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> server segment checks every hour for 
updates of input Earth orientation time series and the output of numerical 
weather models. If no updates happens, it sleeps for an hour. If an update
has happened, the server initiates re-computation of the EOP message.
The EOP message consists of six parts:

<OL>
     <LI> The <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> configuration: names of the model, 
          URLs of input data used by the server, date of their last update 
          etc.
          </LI><P>

     <LI> The table of UTC minus TAI function.
          </LI><P>

     <LI> The coefficients of expansion of IERS C04 time series into B-spline
          basis for the interval since 197.01.01 to the date of their last 
          availability, typically 30&ndash;35 days in the past. The 
          coefficients are computed using IERS C04 time series and provide
          their interpolation.
          </LI><P>

     <LI> The coefficients of expansion of Euler angles E1, E2, E3 into 
          B-spline for the interval of end of IERS C04 time series 
          availability through 48&ndash;72 hours in the future.
          These coefficients provide the short-term forecast.
          The coefficients are estimates with least square using input
          Earth orientation parameter and the atmospheric angular moment 
          (AAM) time series computed from the numerical weather models in 
          the data assimilation and the forecast modes.  The contributing 
          series of E(t) and the AAM are assigned specific weights. The 
          weights are adjusted to provide the best quality of the forecast.
          The AAM dominates forecast 24&ndash;72 hours in the future, while
          the EOP time series dominates at scales 36 hours and further 
          in the past.
          </LI><P>

     <LI> The coefficients of expansion of Euler angles E1, E2, E3 into 
          B-spline for the interval from 72 hours to 6 months in the future.
          These coefficients provide the long-term prediction. The accuracy
          of the long-term prediction is significantly worse than the accuracy
          of the short-term prediction. It is assumed that the long-term 
          prediction will be used only in emergency situation when short-term
          forecast is unavailable.
          </LI><P>

     <LI> The coefficients of small quasi-harmonic variations of Euler angles 
          E1, E2, and E3. These are computed from analysis of space geodesy
          data and are updated 4&ndash;6 times a year.
          </LI><P>

</OL>

  The message is formatted as a binary file and is accessible for downloading
via the HTTP interface.

<H2> NERS client segment </H2>

   The <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> client segment provides a library that
computes the Earth rotation matrix or the Earth orientation parameters
from the NERS message and provides several executables. The client library 
performs three major functions:

<UL>
  <LI> It manages the local copy of the <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> message.
       When the <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> gets a request to provide the 
       Earth's rotation matrix, it first checks the local copy of the 
       message. If the message does not exist, the client automatically 
       downloads it from the <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> server. If it 
       exists, it check its age. If the age is old than the threshold 
       specified in the control file, the client checks the age of the
       message at the server. If the message at the server is newer,
       the client will automatically download it from the server and 
       replaces the local copy.
       </LI><P>

  <LI> It reads, parses the local copy of the <EM class="ners">NERS</EM>,
       and using the coefficients computes the Earth rotation matrix or 
       other Earth orientation parameters. 

  <LI> It supports internal bufferization. A typical use case is 
       computation of the Earth's rotation matrix in a cycle for a number
       of epochs within the specified time range. In order to minimize 
       computation time, the client expands the requested parameter
       over B-spline basis within the specified time range. The client
       will uses these B-spline coefficients for a consequent request 
       to compute the Earth's rotation matrix or other EOPs. It will also
       check the age of these B-spline coefficients, and if the age 
       exceeds the threshold, it will check whether the 
       <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> message is newer.
</UL>

The executables provide the command-line interface to 
<EM class="ners">NERS</EM> library. They parse input parameters,
call routines of <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> library and print out
the output. These executables serve as examples or can be called
from other programs or interpreters when fast execution time is not
required.

<H2> NERS Internet services </H2>

  The <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> supports several Internet services:

<UL>
   <LI> Web interface to <A HREF="/eop_online.html"> computation of the EOP 
        value</A> on the specified moment of time.
        </LI><P>

   <LI> Web interface to <A HREF="/eop_series.html"> computation of the EOP 
        time series</A> on the specified time interval and time step.
        </LI><P>

   <LI> Web interface to <A HREF="/eop_online_now.html"> computation of the EOP 
        values</A> at the current moment of time that is automatically 
        updated every 10 seconds.
        </LI><P>
</UL>
  
  These services have a web form that runs <EM class="ners">NERS</EM> executables
at the server. They can be used interactively  by filling the form manually,
of using via <A HREF="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget">wget</A>, 
<A HREF="https://curl.haxx.se">curl</A>, or other tools for automatically 
retrieval the results of parsing form as it 
<A HREF="/use_case.html#level2">is explained here</A>.
