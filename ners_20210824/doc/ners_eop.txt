Program ners_eop retrieves the Earth orientation parameters at the 
specified epoch from the Network Earth Rotation Service (NERS)
server and prints it in stdout.

Usage:

   ners_eop [-h] [-c config_file] [-p param] [-t date] [-v verb_level] [-r] [-i]

-h              prints this file and exits.

-c config_file  name of the ners client configuration file.
                If omitted, ners_eop will first search $HOME/.ners_config
                and if it does not find, uses file share/ners.config
                in ners installation directory.

-p param        EOP parameter(s) to  be displayed. Supported parameters:
