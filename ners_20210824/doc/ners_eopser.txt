Programs ners_eopser generates the Earth orientation parameters time series 
for the specified range of epochs with the specified step using the Network 
Earth Rotation Service server and prints it in stdout.

Usage:

   ners_eopser [-h] [-c config_file] -p param_name -b start date -e stop date 
               -s time_step [-v verbosity] [-r ]

-h              prints this file and exits.

-c config_file  name of the ners client configuration file.
                If omitted, ners_eop will first search $HOME/.ners_config
                and if it does not find, uses file share/ners.config
                in ners installation directory.
