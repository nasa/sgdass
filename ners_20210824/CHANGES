2023.10.17  2.150 Added support of an option ine ners_eopser
                  to specify the end epoch ofthe series
                  up to 90 days in the future.

2021.08.24  2.140 Make the model of contribution to UT1 due to
                  zonal tides configurable.

                  Added support of Ray & Erofeeva (2014) model
                  for the contribution of zonal tides to UT1.

                  Added new EOP types: poluz, poluz_r, ezrr
                  eop3zr, eop3zs. They include the Euler angle
                  around axis 3 with the contribution of zonal 
                  tides to UT1 removed.

                  Version of client earlier than 2.140 are incompatible
                  with NERS server messages 2.140 or newer.

2021.07.17  2.130 Decreased frequency of leap second file to be
                  updated. Added a check whether the temporary
                  leap second file is empty.

2020.11.20  2.120 Added EOP cashing for azimuth/elevation computation.
                  Set group write permission by default to all NERS
                  related files and NERS source code.

2019.10.20  2.110 Rewrote locking support.

                  Fixed behavior with no Internet connection: 
                  the previous version stopped with the error
                  message. This behavior is configurable now.

                  Added two additional configuration parameters:

                     ON_FAIL_TO_READ: -- defines behavior when NERS cannot
                                         read the message from the server:
                           stop    -- stop with the error message
                           warning -- issue the warning and continue
                           ignore  -- continue without warning

                     LOCK_TIMEOUT:     -- timeout in seconds for locking

2019.05.15  2.100 Made it working without setting GOMP_STACKSIZE 
                  environment variable and without setting limits to 
                  rather large number.

2018.06.28  2.90  Added computation of hour angles and renamed ners_azel
                        to ners_azelha

                  Fixed installation program related to bug
                    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41080
                  Fixed compilation errors raised by Intel fortran compiler
                  Fixed ners_eop regression bug when the EOP is computed 
                    at the current moment of time.
                  Added support of LDFLAGS in configure
                  
2018.06.15  2.80  Added Python wrapper
                  Added program ners_azel for computing azimuth and elevation
                  Fixed a number of bugs. 
                  Changed ABI.

2018.05.31  2.70  Made NERS thread-safe. 
                  Added support of environment variable NERS_CONFIG
                  that specifies the name of the NERS configuration file.
                  Fixed documentation.

2018.04.22  2.60  Fixed a bug related to double counting the secular term
                  in nutation that may be present in the expression for
                  precession.

2018.01.06  2.50  Fixed jumps in EOP at the interval of transition
                  from IERS C04 to NERS forecast. 
                  Improved documentation.
                  Added check for BSD legacy csh.
