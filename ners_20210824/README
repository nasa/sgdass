  Ners package provides a client to the Network Earth Rotation Service (NERS).
It consists of the library, python3 module and five four executable. The ners 
library communicates with the NERS server, downloads the file with the Earth 
rotation parameters from 1976.01.01 through 48 hours in the future and 
computes the EOP value or the array of values at the specified epoch or the 
time series at the specified interval with the given step.

  The executables print the Earth orientation parameters at the standard output:

     ners_eop    -- retrieves the requested EOP on the specified epoch from 
                    NERS and prints it into stdout.
     
     ners_eopser -- generates the series of the requested EOP on the specified 
                    time range and the specified step from NERS and prints the 
                    series into stdout.
     
     ners_azelha -- program that computes azimuth, elevation and hour angle 
                    at a requested epoch for a station with given positions 
                    observing a source with given coordinates.

     ut1mtai     -- prints the current UT1 minus TAI angle into stdout.
     
     utcmtai     -- prints the current value of UTC minus TAI angle into stdout.


Refer doc folder for documentation.

  The rms error of the Earth orientation forecast at the current epoch
is 1.1 nrad for the components 1 and 2 (pole coordinates) and 2.8 nrad 
for the component 3 (UT1).
