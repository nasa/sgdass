Ners runs under Linux or MAC OS.
Dependencies:
                                           
1) tcsh. Comment: tcsh should have symbolic link to csh.
         Old bsd csh is not supported.
2) gcc C compiler
3) Fortran compiler: either gfortran or Intel
4) wget ( https://www.gnu.org/software/wget )
5) Optionally, python version 3.2 or newer.

Ners can be configured in two modes: standalone and with dependency
to petools library. If you do not know what petools library is, 
probably, you should configure ners in the standalone mode,
i.e. without specifying --with-petools= as argument for configure.
Ners installs python module by default. If you do not want to use
the python module, you can configure python without python support
with specifying --without-python.

  To configure ners, run ./configure with arguments.
To see the list if arguments, run 

./configure -h

Script configure honors the following environment variables:

  CC      -- full path to C compiler (gcc by default)
  FC      -- full path to Fortran compiler (gfortran by default)
  LDFLAGS -- additional commands appended to the linker

When you configure ners with petools, you need to specify installation
directory for petools.

Example:

./configure --prefix=/opt64 FC=/opt64/bin/gfortran  --python-dir=/opt64/script

After you run configure, just execute

make
make example
make install

Installed files:

1) library ${NERS_PREFIX}/lib/libners.a
           ${NERS_PREFIX}/lib/libners.so    (Linux) or 
           ${NERS_PREFIX}/lib/libners.dylib (MacOS)

2) include files:
